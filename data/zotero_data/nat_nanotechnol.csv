Here we develop a combinatorial approach addressing these barriers. First, we observe that LNP formulations can be stabilized to resist nebulization-induced aggregation by altering the nebulization buffer to increase the LNP charge during nebulization, and by the addition of a branched polymeric excipient. Next, we synthesize a combinatorial library of ionizable, degradable lipids using reductive amination, and evaluate their delivery potential using fully differentiated air–liquid interface cultured primary lung epithelial cells. The final combination of ionizable lipid, charge-stabilized formulation and stability-enhancing excipient yields a significant improvement in lung mRNA delivery over current state-of-the-art LNPs and polymeric nanoparticles.","2023-11-20","2023-11-29 05:33:15","2024-05-28 07:45:36","2023-11-29 05:33:15","1-12","","","","","Nat.

Inorganic NPs, unlike organic NPs, perturb the biogenesis of microglial EVs through the inhibition of ERK1/2 signalling. This increases the accumulation of inorganic NPs in microglia, hindering their elimination via the paravascular route. We also demonstrate that stimulating the release of microglial EVs by an ERK1/2 activator increased the paravascular glymphatic pathway-mediated brain clearance of inorganic NPs.

Here we introduce a three-dimensional (3D) stacking implantable electronic platform, based on perfluorinated dielectric elastomers and tissue-level soft multilayer electrodes, that enables spatiotemporally scalable single-cell neural electrophysiology in the nervous system. Our elastomers exhibit stable dielectric performance for over a year in physiological solutions and are 10,000 times softer than conventional plastic dielectrics. By leveraging these unique characteristics we develop the packaging of lithographed nanometre-thick electrode arrays in a 3D configuration with a cross-sectional density of 7.6 electrodes per 100 µm2. The resulting 3D integrated multilayer soft electrode array retains tissue-level flexibility, reducing chronic immune responses in mouse neural tissues, and demonstrates the ability to reliably track electrical activity in the mouse brain or spinal cord over months without disrupting animal behaviour.","2024-03","2024-05-26 17:18:08","2024-05-28 07:43:38","2024-05-26 17:18:08","319-329","","3","19","","Nat.

The highest VEGF-A secretion occurs in a subpopulation of mesenchymal stromal cells characterized by a unique gene expression signature comprising a surface marker, interleukin-13 receptor subunit alpha 2 (IL13RA2), which allowed the enrichment of this subpopulation.

We prove that the interplay at the nanoscale between the water–ion and water–water interaction can lead to an effective ion–ion attraction overcoming the ionic Coulomb repulsion. The tendency for different ions to become closely packed follows the sequence K+ > Na+ > Li+, which is attributed to their different dehydration energies and charge densities.

However, in the dynamic environment of the respiratory tract, forces act on the binding partners, which raises the question of whether not only affinity but also force stability of the SARS-CoV-2–ACE2 interaction might be a selection factor for mutations. Using magnetic tweezers, we investigate the impact of amino acid substitutions in variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta) and on force-stability and bond kinetic of the receptor-binding domain–ACE2 interface at a single-molecule resolution. We find a higher affinity for all of the variants of concern (>fivefold) compared with the wild type. In contrast, Alpha is the only variant of concern that shows higher force stability (by 17%) compared with the wild type. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we rationalize the mechanistic molecular origins of this increase in force stability. Our study emphasizes the diversity of contributions to the transmissibility of variants and establishes force stability as one of the several factors for fitness. Understanding fitness advantages opens the possibility for the prediction of probable mutations, allowing a rapid adjustment of therapeutics, vaccines and intervention measures.","2024-03","2024-05-26 17:18:08","2024-05-28 07:44:16","2024-05-26 17:18:08","399-405","","3","19","","Nat.

Despite remarkable liquid repellency driven by surface energy in many organisms, repelling tiny solid particles from surfaces is rare. The main challenge lies in the unfavourable scaling of inertia versus adhesion in the microscale and the inability of solids to release surface energy. Here we report a previously unexplored solid repellency on a honeybee’s comb: a catapult-like effect to immediately eject pollen after grooming dirty antennae for self-cleaning. Nanoindentation tests revealed the 38-μm-long comb features a stiffness gradient spanning nearly two orders of magnitude from ~25 MPa at the tip to ~645 MPa at the base. This significantly augments the elastic energy storage and accelerates the subsequent conversion into kinetic energy. The reinforcement in energy storage and conversion allows the particle’s otherwise weak inertia to outweigh its adhesion, thereby suppressing the unfavourable scaling effect and realizing solid repellency that is impossible in conventional uniform designs. We capitalize on this to build an elastomeric bioinspired stiffness-gradient catapult and demonstrate its generality and practicality. Our findings advance the fundamental understanding of natural catapult phenomena with the potential to develop bioinspired stiffness-gradient materials, catapult-based actuators and robotic cleaners.","2024-02","2024-05-26 17:18:08","2024-05-28 07:44:18","2024-05-26 17:18:09","219-225","","2","19","","Nat.

Impaired IR signalling is associated with multiple diseases, including diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. IRs have been reported to form nanoclusters at the cell membrane in several cell types, even in the absence of insulin binding. Here we exploit the nanoscale spatial organization of the IR to achieve controlled multivalent receptor activation. To control insulin nanoscale spatial organization and valency, we developed rod-like insulin–DNA origami nanostructures carrying different numbers of insulin molecules with defined spacings. Increasing the insulin valency per nanostructure markedly extended the residence time of insulin–DNA origami nanostructures at the receptors. Both insulin valency and spacing affected the levels of IR activation in adipocytes. Moreover, the multivalent insulin design associated with the highest levels of IR activation also induced insulin-mediated transcriptional responses more effectively than the corresponding monovalent insulin nanostructures. In an in vivo zebrafish model of diabetes, treatment with multivalent—but not monovalent—insulin nanostructures elicited a reduction in glucose levels. Our results show that the control of insulin multivalency and spatial organization with nanoscale precision modulates the IR responses, independent of the insulin concentration. Therefore, we propose insulin nanoscale organization as a design parameter in developing new insulin therapies.","2024-02","2024-05-26 17:18:08","2024-05-28 07:44:22","2024-05-26 17:18:09","237-245","","2","19","","Nat.

We transfer magnetosome genes to 25 proteobacterial hosts, generating seven new magnetosome-producing strains. We characterize the recombinant magnetosomes produced by these strains and demonstrate that denitrification and anaerobic photosynthesis are linked to the ability to synthesize magnetosomes upon the gene transfer. In addition, we show that the number of magnetosomes synthesized by a foreign host negatively correlates with the guanine–cytosine content difference between the host and the gene donor.

However, clinical adoption of nanoformulated agents is often hindered by concerns about hepatic uptake and clearance, a process that is not fully understood. Here we show that the antitumour efficacy of cancer nanomedicine exhibits an age-associated disparity. Tumour delivery and treatment outcomes are superior in old versus young mice, probably due to an age-related decline in the ability of hepatic phagocytes to take up and remove nanoparticles. Transcriptomic- and protein-level analysis at the single-cell and bulk levels reveals an age-associated decrease in the numbers of hepatic macrophages that express the scavenger receptor MARCO in mice, non-human primates and humans. Therapeutic blockade of MARCO is shown to decrease the phagocytic uptake of nanoparticles and improve the antitumour effect of clinically approved cancer nanotherapeutics in young but not aged mice. Together, these results reveal an age-associated disparity in the phagocytic clearance of nanotherapeutics that affects their antitumour response, thus providing a strong rationale for an age-appropriate approach to cancer nanomedicine.","2024-02","2024-05-26 17:18:08","2024-05-28 07:44:20","2024-05-26 17:18:09","255-263","","2","19","","Nat.

Using inflammation triggered by local hyperthermia, we develop a cooperative immunodriven strategy to overcome the basement membrane barrier that leads to robust tumour killing. Hyperthermia-triggered accumulation and inflammation of platelets attract neutrophils to the NP pools. The subsequent movement of neutrophils through the basement membrane can release the NPs entrapped in the subendothelial void, resulting in increased NP penetration into deeper tumours.

Here we combined multiplexed DNA-based point accumulation in nanoscale topography (DNA-PAINT) imaging with designer DNA nanostructures and measured the free energy of dinucleotide base stacking at the single-molecule level. Multiplexed imaging enabled us to extract the binding kinetics of an imager strand with and without additional dinucleotide stacking interactions. The DNA-PAINT data showed that a single additional dinucleotide base stacking results in up to 250-fold stabilization for the DNA duplex nanostructure. We found that the dinucleotide base-stacking energies vary from −0.95 ± 0.12 kcal mol−1 to −3.22 ± 0.04 kcal mol−1 for C|T and A|C base-stackings, respectively.

Multiple types of sugar-alcohol-derived lipid nanoparticles are conceived to modulate the cancer–immunity cycle. First, one type of lipid nanoparticle containing CD40 ligand mRNA induces robust immunogenic cell death in tumoural tissues, leading to the release of tumour-associated antigens and the expression of CD40 ligand. Next, dendritic cells engineered by another type of lipid nanoparticle encapsulating CD40 mRNA are adoptively transferred, which are then activated by the CD40 ligand molecules in tumoural tissues. This promotes the secretion of multiple cytokines and chemokines, and the upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules on dendritic cells, which are crucial for reprogramming the tumour microenvironment and priming the T-cell responses.

Here we introduce a modular approach by demonstrating DNA-origami-directed polymorphism of single-protein subunit capsids. We achieve control over the capsid shape, size and topology by employing user-defined DNA origami nanostructures as binding and assembly platforms, which are efficiently encapsulated within the capsid. Furthermore, the obtained viral capsid coatings can shield the encapsulated DNA origami from degradation. Our approach is, moreover, not limited to a single type of capsomers and can also be applied to RNA–DNA origami structures to pave way for next-generation cargo protection and targeting strategies.","2023-10","2024-05-26 17:19:28","2024-05-28 07:48:25","2024-05-26 17:19:29","1205-1212","","10","18","","Nat.

MM consist of a polycyclic rotor and stator that rotate around a central alkene when activated with visible light. Live-cell calcium-tracking and pharmacological experiments reveal that MM-induced ICW are driven by the activation of inositol-triphosphate-mediated signalling pathways by unidirectional, fast-rotating MM.

Liposomes are believed to largely transport drugs into inflamed joints by selective extravasation through endothelial gaps at the inflammatory sites, known as the enhanced permeation and retention effect. However, the potential of blood-circulating myeloid cells for the uptake and delivery of liposomes has been largely overlooked. Here we show that myeloid cells can transport liposomes to inflammatory sites in a collagen-induced arthritis model. It is shown that the selective depletion of the circulating myeloid cells reduces the accumulation of liposomes up to 50–60%, suggesting that myeloid-cell-mediated transport accounts for more than half of liposomal accumulation in inflamed regions. Although it is widely believed that PEGylation inhibits premature liposome clearance by the mononuclear phagocytic system, our data show that the long blood circulation times of PEGylated liposomes rather favours uptake by myeloid cells. This challenges the prevailing theory that synovial liposomal accumulation is primarily due to the enhanced permeation and retention effect and highlights the potential for other pathways of delivery in inflammatory diseases.","2023-11","2024-05-26 17:19:28","2024-05-28 07:47:31","2024-05-26 17:19:29","1341-1350","","11","18","","Nat.

Here we develop an LNP component—an adjuvant lipidoid—that can enhance the adjuvanticity of mRNA-LNP vaccines. Our results show that partial substitution of ionizable lipidoid with adjuvant lipidoid not only enhanced mRNA delivery, but also endowed LNPs with Toll-like receptor 7/8-agonistic activity, which significantly increased the innate immunity of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-LNP vaccine with good tolerability in mice. Our optimized vaccine elicits potent neutralizing antibodies against multiple SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus variants, strong Th1-biased cellular immunity, and robust B cell and long-lived plasma cell responses.

By controlling the distance between the nanopore and glass surface, we can actively select the region of interest on the molecule and scan it a controlled number of times and at a controlled velocity. Decreasing the velocity and averaging thousands of consecutive readings of the same molecule increases the signal-to-noise ratio by two orders of magnitude compared with free translocations.

After local or systemic delivery of Cas9, mild heating is induced by non-invasive near-infrared (NIR) light or focused ultrasound (FUS) to activate Cas9, which initiates simultaneous genome editing of HSP70 (HSPA1A) and BAG3 in tumour cells. This disrupts the apoptotic resistance machinery of the tumour cells against adoptive T cells.

This facilitates the infiltration of adoptive T cells and enhances their therapeutic activity. Mild thermal Cas9 delivery is demonstrated in different murine tumour models which mimic a range of clinical indications, including a tumour model based on humanized patient-derived xenografts.

Scalable parallel random access to information is a desirable property of any storage system. For DNA-based storage systems, however, this still needs to be robustly established. Here we report on a thermoconfined polymerase chain reaction, which enables multiplexed, repeated random access to compartmentalized DNA files. The strategy is based on localizing biotin-functionalized oligonucleotides inside thermoresponsive, semipermeable microcapsules. At low temperatures, microcapsules are permeable to enzymes, primers and amplified products, whereas at high temperatures, membrane collapse prevents molecular crosstalk during amplification. Our data show that the platform outperforms non-compartmentalized DNA storage compared with repeated random access and reduces amplification bias tenfold during multiplex polymerase chain reaction.

A wide range of resistive skins has been developed so far to detect a wide variety of biometric signals including blood pressure, skin strain, body temperature and acoustic vibrations; however, they are typically non-specific, with one resistive signal corresponding to a single type of biometric data (one-mode sensors). Here we show a hierarchically resistive skin sensor made of a laminated cracked platinum film, vertically aligned gold nanowires and a percolated gold nanowire film, all integrated into a single sensor. As a result, hierarchically resistive skin displays a staircase-shaped resistive response to tensile strain, with distinct sensing regimes associated to a specific active material. We show that we can, through one resistive signal, identify up to five physical or physiological activities associated with the human throat speech: heartbeats, breathing, touch and neck movement (that is, a multimodal sensor). We develop a frequency/amplitude-based neural network, Deep Hybrid-Spectro, that can automatically disentangle multiple biometrics from a single resistive signal. This system can classify 11 activities—with different combinations of speech, neck movement and touch—with an accuracy of 92.73 ± 0.82% while simultaneously measuring respiration and heart rates.

By squeezing ~5 µm balloon-like extrusions through dense microvilli, transporting intact gold-containing endocytic vesicles into the extrusions along with mitochondria or other organelles and pinching the extrusions off the membranes into the lumen, proximal tubular epithelial cells re-eliminated >95% of endocytosed gold nanoparticles from the kidneys into the urine within a month.

As a possible alternative, a computational method for image resolution enhancement, namely, super-resolution radial fluctuations (SRRF)2,3, has recently been developed. However, this method has not been explored in pathology specimens to date, because on its own, it does not achieve sufficient resolution for routine clinical use. Here, we report expansion-enhanced super-resolution radial fluctuations (ExSRRF), a simple, robust, scalable and accessible workflow that provides a resolution of up to 25 nm using LED-based widefield microscopy. ExSRRF enables molecular profiling of subcellular structures from archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues in complex clinical and experimental specimens, including ischaemic, degenerative, neoplastic, genetic and immune-mediated disorders.

Nanomedicine platforms could address these challenges, but it remains unclear whether synergistic free-drug ratios translate to nanocarriers and whether nanocarriers with multiple drugs outperform mixtures of single-drug nanocarriers at the same dose. Here we report a bottlebrush prodrug (BPD) platform designed to answer these questions in the context of multiple myeloma therapy. We show that proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib)-based BPD monotherapy slows tumour progression in vivo and that mixtures of bortezomib, pomalidomide and dexamethasone BPDs exhibit in vitro synergistic, additive or antagonistic patterns distinct from their corresponding free-drug counterparts. BPDs carrying a statistical mixture of three drugs in a synergistic ratio outperform the free-drug combination at the same ratio as well as a mixture of single-drug BPDs in the same ratio. Our results address unanswered questions in the field of nanomedicine, offering design principles for combination nanomedicines and strategies for improving current front-line monotherapies and combination therapies for multiple myeloma.","2023-02","2024-05-26 17:21:08","2024-05-28 07:47:25","2024-05-26 17:21:09","184-192","","2","18","","Nat.

Here we suggest a kinetically activating nanoadjuvant (K-nanoadjuvant) that can dynamically integrate two waves of innate immune stimuli, resulting in effective antitumour immunity without immune cell exhaustion. The combinatorial code of K-nanoadjuvant is optimized in terms of the order, duration and time window between spatiotemporally activating Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist and other Toll-like receptor agonists. K-nanoadjuvant induces effector/non-exhausted dendritic cells that programme the magnitude and persistence of interleukin-12 secretion, generate effector/non-exhausted CD8+ T cells, and activate natural killer cells. Treatment with K-nanoadjuvant as a monotherapy or in combination therapy with anti-PD-L1 or liposomes (doxorubicin) results in strong antitumour immunity in murine models, with minimal systemic toxicity, providing a strategy for synchronous and dynamic tailoring of innate immunity for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.","2023-04","2024-05-26 17:21:08","2024-05-28 07:48:13","2024-05-26 17:21:09","390-402","","4","18","","Nat.
