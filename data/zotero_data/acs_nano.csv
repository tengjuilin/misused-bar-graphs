These cytosine modifications, especially 5-methylcytosine but also its oxidized derivatives, have been increasingly studied in the context of epigenetics. Recently revealed correlations of epigenetic modifications and disease also render them interesting biomarkers for early diagnosis. Internal kinetic referencing allows us to probe and compare the influence of the different epigenetic cytosine modifications on the strengths of 7-nucleotide long DNA hybrids with one or two modified nucleotides by single-molecule imaging of their transient binding, revealing subtle differences in binding times. Interestingly, the influence of epigenetic modifications depends on their position in the DNA strand, and in the case of two modifications, effects are additive. The sensitivity of the assay indicates its potential for the direct detection of epigenetic disease markers.","2024-01-16","2024-07-04 22:19:20","2024-07-05 21:45:29","2024-07-04 22:17:40","1496-1503","","2","18","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/PFT4PXV4/Bauer et al. - 2024 - Kinetic Referencing Allows Identification of Epige.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we develop a CMA-targeting chimera (CMATAC) to efficiently and specifically degrade signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in tumor cells. CMATAC consists of STAT3 and heat shock cognate 70 kDa protein (HSC70) targeting peptides connected by a linker. To efficiently deliver CMATACs into tumor cells, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are used to encapsulate CMATACs (nCMATACs) and decorated with an insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) targeting peptide (InCMATACs) to achieve tumor targeting and precise delivery. The CMA pathway is activated in tumor cells by a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD). Furthermore, FMD treatment strongly enhances the cellular uptake and tumor accumulation of InCMATACs by upregulating the IGF2R expression. As a result, InCMATACs efficiently degrade STAT3 protein in both A549 and HCC827 tumor cells and inhibit tumor growths in vivo.

To address the limitations, we developed nine orthogonal HCR hairpin-pair (hp) probes in this study to enable efficient signal amplification for multiplex assays. To enhance the efficiency and imaging quality of multiplex assays using these HCR probes, we employed two strategies.

Second, we combined HCR with in situ rolling circle amplification (ISRCA), creating ISRCA-HCR, which achieved a 17-fold signal amplification. ISRCA-HCR demonstrated a high-level imaging capability for spatial cell type assays.

Itaconic acid, known for its excellent biological and reaction activities, has not been extensively studied for the preparation of itaconic acid-based hydrogels and their application in infected wound healing. Therefore, there is a need to develop a multifunctional single-component itaconic acid-based hydrogel that is easy to synthesize and holds promising prospects for clinical use in promoting the healing of infected wounds. In this study, we present a single-component polyitaconate-based hydrogel (PICGI) with antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and biological activity. The PICGI hydrogel demonstrates great potential in promoting healing of infected wounds and skin regeneration. It exhibits desirable thermosensitive, injectable, and adhesive properties, as well as broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, the PICGI hydrogel is biocompatible and significantly enhances the migration and tube formation of endothelial cells. In the case of drug-resistant bacterially infected wounds, the PICGI hydrogel effectively inhibits bacterial infection and inflammation, promotes angiogenesis, and facilitates collagen deposition, thereby accelerating the healing and regeneration of the skin. This study highlights the promising application of the PICGI hydrogel as a single-component hydrogel in tissue repair associated with bacterial infection and inflammation.

When two rationally designed stem-loops were strategically placed at the two terminals of linear padlock probes, the specificity of target recognition was enhanced and the negative signal was significantly delayed. Our design achieved the best single-base discrimination compared with other structures and over a 1000-fold higher sensitivity than that of the conventional padlock probe, validating the effectiveness of this reconstruction. In addition, the underlying mechanisms of our design were elucidated through molecular dynamics simulations, and the versatility was validated with longer and shorter padlocks targeting the same target, as well as five additional targets (four miRNAs and dengue virus – 2 RNA mimic (DENV-2)).

To address this need, we developed a standalone noninvasive, label-free ultrasound technique operating at 40–200 MHz to measure the contractile kinetics of cardiac models, ranging from single adult CMs to 3D microtissue constructs in standard cell culture formats. The high temporal resolution of 1000 fps resolved the beat profile of single mouse CMs paced at up to 9 Hz, revealing limitations of lower speed optical based measurements to resolve beat kinetics or characterize aberrant beats. Coupling of ultrasound with traction force microscopy enabled the measurement of the CM longitudinal modulus and facile estimation of adult mouse CM contractile forces of 2.34 ± 1.40 μN, comparable to more complex measurement techniques. Similarly, the beat rate, rhythm, and drug responses of CM spheroid and microtissue models were measured, including in configurations without optical access. In conclusion, ultrasound can be used for the rapid characterization of CM contractile function in a wide range of commonly studied configurations ranging from single cells to 3D tissue constructs using standard well plates and custom microdevices, with applications in cardiac drug discovery and cardiotoxicity evaluation.","2024-01-09","2024-07-04 22:19:20","2024-07-05 21:51:22","2024-07-04 22:17:46","314-327","","1","18","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/TS6B5DK6/Strohm et al. - 2024 - Noninvasive Quantification of Contractile Dynamics.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we investigate the use of a monodisperse nanodroplet formulation for achieving antivascular effects in tumors. We first develop stable low boiling point monodisperse lipid nanodroplets and examine them as an alternative agent to mediate antivascular ultrasound. With synchronous intravital imaging and ultrasound monitoring of focused ultrasound-stimulated nanodroplets in tumor microvasculature, we show that nanodroplets can trigger blood flow shutdown and do so with a sharper pressure threshold and with fewer additional events than conventionally used microbubbles. We further leverage the smaller size and prolonged pharmacokinetic profile of nanodroplets to allow for potential passive accumulation in tumor tissue prior to antivascular ultrasound, which may be a means by which to promote selective tumor targeting.

Single-layer binary fiber nanocomposite membranes (SBFNMs) (PVDF/CNTX@PAN/CNTX, DPCPCX) with two distinct interpenetrating nanocomposite fibers were created through co-electrospinning, incorporating multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN), respectively. The resulting membrane demonstrated an exceptional synergistic effect of piezoelectricity and triboelectricity along with a high machine-to-electric conversion capability. The addition of CNTs increased the PVDF β-phase and the PAN planar zigzag conformation. As a result, the DPCPC0.5-SBFNMs-based piezoelectric nanogenerator exhibited excellent electrical output (187 V, 8.0 μA, and 1.52 W m–2), maintaining an exceptionally high level of output voltage compared with other piezoelectric nanogenerators. It successfully illuminated 50 commercial light-emitting diodes simultaneously. The output voltage of DPCPC0.5-SBFNMs was 5.1 and 4.6 times higher than that of PAN or PVDF single-fiber membranes, respectively.

After crossing the surface location with convex patterns, the deformed MMPs undergo an intrinsic oscillating process to induce damped electrical signals, which can then be converted to a frequency domain for eigenfrequency extraction. Via precisely defining the specific eigenfrequencies of different MMPs, position mapping is realized in crosstalk-free behavior even though all signals are processed by one communication channel and a pair of electrodes.

The quality of muscles is increased by 30%, and muscle movement function is effectively improved. Although nanofibers need to be implanted into muscles, they can improve bacterial infections after joint surgery. To investigate the biological mechanism of this core–shell nanomembrane prevention, we conducted further transcriptomic studies on muscle, confirming that in addition to achieving antioxidation and anti-inflammation by inhibiting TNF-α and NF-κB signaling pathways, tea polyphenol core–shell nanofibers can also promote muscle formation by activating the p-Akt signaling pathway.","2024-01-09","2024-07-04 22:19:20","2024-07-05 21:51:13","2024-07-04 22:17:53","919-930","","1","18","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/WG448FZ2/Tan et al. - 2024 - Implantable Epigallocatechin Gallate Sustained-Rel.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, Zn dendrites and side reactions (e.g., corrosion, hydrogen evolution reaction, and inactive side product (Zn hydroxide sulfate) formation) at the Zn metal anode have been serious obstacles to realizing a satisfactory AZIB performance. The application of gel electrolytes is a common strategy for suppressing these problems, but the normally used highly cross-linked polymer matrix (e.g., polyacrylamide (PAM)) brings additional difficulties for battery assembly and recycling. Herein, we have developed a gel electrolyte for Zn metal anode stabilization, where a peptide matrix, a highly biocompatible material, is used for gel construction. Various experiments and simulations elucidate the sulfate anion-assisted self-assembly gel formation and its effect in stabilizing Zn metal anodes. Unlike polymer gel electrolytes, the peptide gel electrolyte can reversibly transform between gel and liquid states, thus facilitating the gel-involved battery assembly and recycling. Furthermore, the peptide gel electrolyte provides fast Zn ion diffusion (comparable to conventional liquid electrolyte) while suppressing side reactions and dendrite growth, thus achieving highly stable Zn metal anodes as validated in various cell configurations. We believe that our concept of gel electrolyte design will inspire more future directions for Zn metal anode protection based on gel electrolyte design.","2024-01-09","2024-07-04 22:19:20","2024-07-05 21:49:54","2024-07-04 22:17:54","164-177","","1","18","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/85QXG94S/Wang et al. - 2024 - Peptide Gel Electrolytes for Stabilized Zn Metal A.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Single-molecule nanopore sensing promises to provide this level of resolution. In order to be able to identify these differences in a biofluid such as serum, it is necessary to carefully characterize electrical parameters to obtain specific signatures of each biomarker population observed. We are interested here in a family of peptide biomarkers, kinins such as bradykinin and des-Arg9 bradykinin, that are involved in many disabling pathologies (allergy, asthma, angioedema, sepsis, or cancer). We show the proof of concept for direct identification of these biomarkers in serum at the single-molecule level using a protein nanopore. Each peptide exhibits two unique electrical signatures attributed to specific conformations in bulk. The same signatures are found in serum, allowing their discrimination and identification in a complex mixture such as biofluid. To extend the utility of our experimental results, we developed a principal component analysis approach to define the most relevant electrical parameters for their identification. Finally, we used semisupervised classification to assign each event type to a specific biomarker at physiological serum concentration. In the future, single-molecule scale analysis of peptide biomarkers using a powerful nanopore coupled with machine learning will facilitate the identification and quantification of other clinically relevant biomarkers from biofluids.","2024-01-09","2024-07-04 22:19:20","2024-07-05 21:54:54","2024-07-04 22:17:55","539-550","","1","18","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/8JIDUGCH/Greive et al. - 2024 - Identification of Conformational Variants for Brad.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, electrical PUFs using nanomaterials or two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) often have limited entropy and parameter space sources, both of which increase the vulnerability to attacks and act as bottlenecks for practical applications. We report an electrical PUF with enhanced entropy as well as parameter space by incorporating 2D TMDC heteronanostructures into field-effect transistors (FETs). Lateral heteronanostructures of 2D molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide serve as a potent entropy source. The variable feature of FETs is further leveraged to enhance the parameter space that provides multiple challenge–response pairs, which are essential for PUFs. This combination results in stably repeatable yet highly variable FET characteristics as alternative electrical PUFs. Comprehensive PUF performance analyses validate the bit uniformity, reproducibility, uniqueness, randomness, false rates, and encoding capacity.

Nanoenabled targeted drug delivery to the inflamed intestinal mucosa has shown promise in inducing and maintaining colitis remission, while minimizing side effects. Inspired by the excellent antioxidative and anti-inflammatory efficacy of naturally derived magnolol (Mag) and gut homeostasis regulation of microbiota-derived butyrate, we developed a pH/redox dual-responsive butyrate-rich polymer nanoparticle (PSBA) as an oral Mag delivery system for combinational therapy of IBD. PSBA showed a high butyrate content of 22% and effectively encapsulated Mag. The Mag-loaded nanoparticles (PSBA@Mag) demonstrated colonic pH and reduction-responsive drug release, ensuring efficient retention and adhesion in the colon of colitis mice. PSBA@Mag not only normalized the level of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory effectors in inflamed colonic mucosa but also restored the epithelial barrier function in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease mouse models. Importantly, PSBA promoted the migration and healing ability of intestinal epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo, sensitizing the therapeutic efficacy of Mag in animal models. Moreover, transcriptomics and metabolism analyses revealed that PSBA@Mag mitigated inflammation by suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and restoring the lipid metabolism. Additionally, this nanomedicine modulated the gut microbiota by inhibiting pathogenic Proteus and Escherichia-Shigella and promoting the proliferation of beneficial probiotics, including Lachnoclostridium, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group and norank_f_Ruminococcaceae.

By controlling the solvent polarity and forming numerous weak interactions (such as hydrogen bonding) between chiral ligands and TiO2, we successfully prepared chiral TiO2 superparticles (SPs) that exhibited a broad circular dichroism (CD) absorption at 792 nm.

As a key feature of integrins, their activity, structure and behavior are highly mechanosensitive, which are regulated by mechanical forces down to pico-Newton scale. Using single-molecule biomechanical approaches, we compared the force-modulated ectodomain bending/unbending conformational changes of two integrin species, α5β1 and αVβ3. It was found that the conformation of integrin α5β1 is determined by a threshold head-to-tail tension. By comparison, integrin αVβ3 exhibits bistability even without force and can spontaneously transition between the bent and extended conformations with an apparent transition time under a wide range of forces. Molecular dynamics simulations observed almost concurrent disruption of ∼2 hydrogen bonds during integrin α5β1 unbending, but consecutive disruption of ∼7 hydrogen bonds during integrin αVβ3 unbending. Accordingly, we constructed a canonical energy landscape for integrin α5β1 with a single energy well that traps the integrin in the bent state until sufficient force tilts the energy landscape to allow the conformational transition. In contrast, the energy landscape of integrin αVβ3 conformational changes was constructed with hexa-stable intermediate states and intermediate energy barriers that segregate the conformational change process into multiple small steps. Our study elucidates the different biomechanical inner workings of integrins α5β1 and αVβ3 at the submolecular level, helps understand their mechanosignaling processes and how their respective functions are facilitated by their distinctive mechanosensitivities, and provides useful design principles for the engineering of protein-based biomechanical nanomachines.","2024-01-09","2024-07-04 22:19:20","2024-07-05 21:57:10","2024-07-04 22:18:14","299-313","","1","18","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/4HF3N2NS/Chen et al. - 2024 - Force-Regulated Spontaneous Conformational Changes.pdf","","Others","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through monolayer confrontation of MCF10A (nontumorigenic human breast epithelial cells) and MDA-MB-231 (human epithelial breast cancer cells) cells, we investigate the epithelial–cancerous interfacial interactions at the tissue level. We show that the monolayer interaction leads to competitive interfacial morphodynamics and drives an intricate spatial organization of MCF10A cells into multicellular finger-like structures, which further branch into multiple subfinger-like structures. These hierarchical interfacial structures penetrate the cancer monolayer and can spontaneously segregate or even envelop cancer cell clusters, consistent with our theoretical prediction. By tracking the substrate displacements via embedded fluorescent nanobeads and implementing nanomechanical modeling that combines atomic force microscopy and finite element simulations, we computed mechanical force patterns, including traction forces and monolayer stresses, caused by the monolayer interaction. It is found that the heterogeneous mechanical forces accumulated in the monolayers are able to squeeze cancer cells, leading to three-dimensional interfacial bulges or cell extrusion, initiating the p53 apoptosis signaling pathways of cancer cells. We reveal that intercellular E-cadherin and P-cadherin of epithelial cells differentially regulate the interfacial organization including migration speed, directionality, spatial correlation, F-actin alignment, and subcellular protrusions of MCF10A cells; whereas E-cadherin governs interfacial geometry that is relevant to force localization and cancer cell extrusion, P-cadherin maintains interfacial integrity that enables long-range force transmission.

Currently, Golgi targeting technologies are mostly employed in Golgi-specific fluorescent probes for diagnosis, but their applications in therapy are rarely reported. Herein, we proposed a prodrug (INR) that can target and destroy the Golgi apparatus, which consisted of indomethacin (IMC) as the Golgi targeting moiety and retinoic acid (RA), a Golgi disrupting agent. The linker between IMC and RA was designed as a hypoxia-responsive nitroaromatic structure, which ensured the release of the prototype drugs in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, INR could be assembled with pirarubicin (THP), an anthracycline, to form a carrier-free nanoparticle (NP) by emulsion-solvent evaporation method. A small amount of mPEG2000-DSPE was added to shield the positive charges and improve the stability of the nanoparticle to obtain PEG-modified nanoparticle (PNP). It was proved that INR released the prototype drugs in tumor cells and hypoxia promoted the release. The Golgi destructive effect of RA in INR was amplified owing to the Golgi targeting ability of IMC, and IMC also inhibited the protumor COX-2/PGE2 signaling. Finally, PNP exhibited excellent curative efficacy on 4T1 primary tumor and its pulmonary and hepatic metastasis.

Moreover, the key regulatory processes and the key genes for cell damage and cell death caused by CuO NPs were revealed by RNA-Seq. We also conducted in vivo experiments using a rat model to examine the contraceptive efficacy of both the bare CuO NPs and the CuO/thermosensitive hydrogel nanocomposite.

Active targeting can be realized through homologous effects derived from source tumor cell membranes, which advantageously elevates the specific drug delivery to tumor sites. After being engulfed into tumor cells, the nanogels exhibit a burst drug release at low pH. The near-infrared (NIR) photoinduced local hyperthermia can activate severe cytotoxicity and further accelerate drug release, thus generating enhanced synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy to thoroughly eradicate tumors.

In this work, a “nasal in situ assembly” strategy was presented to construct intranasal morphology transformation nanomedicines with enhanced effective drug concentration for long-term intervention of allergic rhinitis. The polymer-polypeptide nanomedicine (PHCK) with a CCR3 antagonistic peptide (C) and a pH-responsive polyethylene glycol (H) was developed, encapsulating ketotifen (KT). PHCK nanoparticles displayed nasal mucosa permeability and transformed to nanofibers in the acidic environment of the nasal cavity, realizing responsive burst release of KT simultaneously. The fibrotic reassembly reduced the cellular internalization of nanomedicine and increased the CCR3 blockade on the eosinophil (EOS) membranes. Both in vitro and in vivo data indicated that PHCK achieved improved drug accumulation and retention in the nasal cavity and decreased pulmonary deposition, then effectively inhibited mast cell degranulation and EOS chemotaxis.

Further investigation found that PS-NPs disturbed mitochondrial structure and function and triggered autophagy. Mechanistically, oxidative stress-derived mitochondrial damage contributed to ferroptosis, and autophagy-dependent ferritinophagy was a pivotal intermediate link, resulting in ferritin degradation and iron ion release.

In this study, we introduce a facile anisotropic interface successive assembly approach to synthesize asymmetric core–shell MOF (ZIF-67) nanobowls with worm-like mesopores in the core and intrinsic micropores in the shell.

By utilizing this multi-interface-driven approach, we enable the creation of diverse geometries and distributions of mesopores and micropores in asymmetric MOF nanoarchitectures. The obtained bowl-like meso-/microporous core–shell ZIF-67 particles exhibit enhanced catalytic activity for CO2 cycloaddition, attributed to reactant accumulation within the bowl-like architecture, active site accessibility in the open mesoporous core, and improved structural stability.

The feasibility and generality of this self-assembly method was demonstrated by the observation of six different metal single atoms (MSAs) including Ag, Pt, Pd, Zn, Cu, and Ni. With Pd as a representative, key factors dominating the fabrication were determined. The Pd single atoms exhibited excellent horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-like activity, which was further improved by 50% via genetic editing of the M13 pVIII protein terminals. Excellent stability was also observed in the quantification of acid phosphatase, a cancer predictor.

In this work, we demonstrate that a light-augmented biomimetic multi-ion interaction in an MXene membrane can simultaneously realize high permeability of Na+ ions for enhanced osmotic power generation and high selectivity to heavy metal ions up to a ratio of 2050 for wastewater treatment. The Na+ permeability is enhanced by the photothermal effect of the MXene membrane.

As a result, the membrane can stably generate osmotic power from simulated industrial wastewater, and the power density can be enhanced by 4 times under light illumination of approximate 1 sun intensity.

To address these limitations, we fabricated ischemic-limb-targeting stem cell-derived exosomes and oxygen-releasing nanoparticles and codelivered them in order to recruit endothelial and skeletal muscle cells, improve cell survival under ischemia before vasculature is established, and restore cell morphogenic function under high glucose and ischemic conditions.

However, conventional electrostatically charged melt-blown microfiber masks typically require thick and dense membranes to achieve high filtration efficiency, which in turn cause a significant pressure drop and reduce breathability. In this study, we have developed a multielectrospinning system to address this issue by manipulating the pore structure of nanofiber networks, including the use of uniaxially aligned nanofibers created via an electric-field-guided electrospinning apparatus. In contrast to the common randomly collected microfiber membranes, partially aligned dual-nanofiber membranes, which are fabricated via electrospinning of a random 150 nm nanofiber base layer and a uniaxially aligned 450 nm nanofiber spacer layer on a roll-to-roll collector, offer an efficient way to modulate nanofiber membrane pore structures. Notably, the dual-nanofiber configuration with submicron pore structure exhibits increased fiber density and decreased volume density, resulting in an enhanced filtration efficiency of over 97% and a 50% reduction in pressure drop. This leads to the highest quality factor of 0.0781. Moreover, the submicron pore structure within the nanofiber networks introduces an additional sieving filtration mechanism, ensuring superior filtration efficiency under highly humid conditions and even after washing with a 70% ethanol solution. The nanofiber mask provides a sustainable solution for safeguarding the human respiratory system, as it effectively filters and inactivates human coronaviruses while utilizing 130 times fewer polymeric materials than melt-blown filters. This reusability of our filters and their minimum usage of polymeric materials would significantly reduce plastic waste for a sustainable global society.","2024-01-16","2024-07-04 22:19:20","2024-07-05 21:45:58","2024-07-04 22:18:45","1371-1380","","2","18","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/U5KHUBMY/Bae et al. - 2024 - Advancing Breathability of Respiratory Nanofilter .pdf","","Others","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Commonly, assailants use GHB in secret for the crime of drug-facilitated sexual assault because it is tasteless, odorless, and colorless when dissolved in beverages. Generally, GHB detection methods are difficult to use promptly and secretly in situ and in real life because of the necessary detection equipment and low selectivity. To overcome this problem, we have developed a fast, simple, and easy-to-use second skin platform as a confidential self-protection platform that can detect GHB in situ or in real life without equipment. The second skin platform for naked-eye detection of GHB is fabricated with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), polyurethane (PU), and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) included in the chemical receptor 2-(3-bromo-4-hydroxystyryl)-3-ethylbenzothiazol-3-ium iodide (BHEI). PAN conjugated with BHEI nanofibers (PB NFs) has various characteristics, such as ease of use, high sensitivity, and fast color change. PB NFs rapidly detected GHB at 0.01 mg/mL. Furthermore, the second-skin platform attached to the fingertip and wrist detected both 1 and 0.1 mg/mL GHB in solution within 50 s. The color changes caused by the interaction of GHB and the second skin platform cannot be stopped due to strong chemical reactions. In addition, a second skin platform can be secretly utilized in real life because it can recognize fingerprints and object temperatures.

Mechanotherapeutics have formed a recent class of drugs that aim to restore biomechanical abnormalities of the tumor microenvironment, related to increased stiffness and hypo-perfusion. Here, we have developed a polymeric formulation containing pirfenidone, which has been successful in restoring the tumor microenvironment in breast tumors and sarcomas. We found that the micellar formulation can induce similar mechanotherapeutic effects to mouse models of 4T1 and E0771 triple negative breast tumors and MCA205 fibrosarcoma tumors but with a dose 100-fold lower than that of the free pirfenidone. Importantly, a combination of pirfenidone-loaded micelles with immune checkpoint inhibition significantly delayed primary tumor growth, leading to a significant improvement in overall survival and in a complete cure for the E0771 tumor model. Furthermore, the combination treatment increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration and suppressed myeloid-derived suppressor cells, creating favorable immunostimulatory conditions, which led to immunological memory.

Plant-derived extracellular vesicles have provided options for VC treatment since they can be used as biomimetic drug carriers with higher biosafety and targeting abilities than artificial carriers. Inspired by natural grapefruit-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), we fabricated a biomimetic nanocarrier comprising EVs loaded with STS and further modified with hydroxyapatite crystal binding peptide (ESTP) for VC-targeted delivery of STS. In vitro, the ESTP nanodrug exhibited excellent cellular uptake capacity by calcified vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and subsequently inhibited VSMCs calcification. In the VC mice model, the ESTP nanodrug showed preferentially the highest accumulation in the calcified arteries compared to other treatment groups. Mechanistically, the ESTP nanodrug significantly prevented VC via driving M2 macrophage polarization, reducing inflammation, and suppressing bone-vascular axis as demonstrated by inhibiting osteogenic phenotype trans-differentiation of VSMCs while enhancing bone quality. In addition, the ESTP nanodrug did not induce hemolysis or cause any damage to other organs. These results suggest that the ESTP nanodrug can prove to be a promising agent against VC without the concern of systemic toxicity.","2023-12-26","2024-07-04 22:19:20","2024-07-05 23:47:21","2024-07-04 22:18:48","24773-24789","","24","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/TJGKIC35/Feng et al. - 2023 - Biomimetic Grapefruit-Derived Extracellular Vesicl.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TPOP could capture tumor antigens and induce specific recognition by TIDCs to be taken up.

However, certain types of cancers lack the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4), a key modulator of ferroptosis, resulting in therapy resistance and tumor relapse. Because ACSL4 is in charge of the synthesis of ferroptotic lipids (e.g., arachidonoylphosphatidylethanolamine/PE-AA), we postulated that direct delivery of PE-AA may reverse ferroptosis resistance induced by ACSL4 deficiency. To further increase the ferroptosis sensitivity, we employed the ferrocene-bearing polymer micelles to co-load PE-AA with an FDA-approved redox modulator, auranofin (Aur), targeting the thioredoxin reductase. The presence of ferrocene enabled triggered cargo release and iron production, which can sensitize ferroptosis by boosting autoxidation-mediated PE-AA peroxidation. The micellar system could impair redox homeostasis and induce lipid peroxidation in ACSL4-deficient MCF-7 cells. Moreover, the tailored micelles potently induced ferroptosis in MCF-7 tumors in vivo, suppressed tumor growth, and increased the mice’s survival rate.

Specifically, TCPP-TK-PEG-PAMAM-FA, a nanoscale multicomponent functional polymer with self-assembly capability, was synthesized for cooperatively entrapping hafnium ions (Hf4+) and HIF-1α-inhibiting siRNAs (siHIF-1α). The TCPP@Hf-TK-PEG-PAMAM-FA@siHIF-1α nanoassemblies are specifically taken in by folate receptor-overexpressing tumor cells and activated by the elevated cellular ROS stress. siHIF-1α could readily inhibit the FABP3/7 expression in tumor cells via HIF-1α-FABP3/7 signaling and abolish lipid droplet biogenesis for enhancing the peroxidation susceptibility of membrane lipids, which synergizes with the elevated ROS stress in the context of Hf4+-enhanced radiation exposure and evokes pronounced ferroptotic damage in vital membrane structures. Interestingly, TCPP@Hf-TK-PEG-PAMAM-FA@siHIF-1α-enhanced ferroptotic biomembrane damage also facilitates the exposure of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) to promote post-LDR immunotherapeutic effects, leading to robust tumor regression in vivo.

The LNP loaded with autoantigens of MS allowed for inducing tolerogenic DCs with low-level expression of costimulatory molecules while presenting antigenic peptides. Intravenous injection of an LNP-based tolerogenic vaccine into an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model led to durable antigen-specific immune tolerance via inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs). Autoreactive T helper type 1 cells, T helper type 17 cells, and inflammatory antigen presentation cells (APCs) were suppressed in the central nervous system (CNS), ameliorating ongoing MS in early and late disease states. Additionally, the incorporation of dexamethasone into an LNP-based tolerogenic nanovaccine could further improve the recovery of EAE mice in the severe chronic stage.

Animals were exposed by single oropharyngeal aspiration to h-BN or BNNTs. On days 1, 7, and 28, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids and lungs were collected.

Two-dimensional h-BN did not cause any significant immune response or lung damage, although the presence of materials was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. In addition, the low aspect ratio h-BN nanosheets were internalized rapidly by phagocytic cells present in alveoli, resulting in efficient clearance from the lungs. In contrast, high aspect ratio BNNTs caused a strong and long-lasting inflammatory response, characterized by sustained inflammation up to 28 days after exposure and the activation of both innate and adaptive immunity. Moreover, the presence of granulomatous structures and an indication of ongoing fibrosis as well as DNA damage in the lung parenchyma were evidenced with these materials. Concurrently, BNNTs were identified in lung sections for up to 28 days, suggesting long-term biopersistence, as previously demonstrated for other high aspect ratio nanomaterials with poor lung clearance such as multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs).

Strikingly, cloning mexT from WT into ES reverts the imipenem and ciprofloxacin resistance to the original level.

Current strategies for prognostic evaluation of macrophages mainly target the specific biomarkers to reveal the number and distribution of macrophages in the tumors, whereas the phenotypic change of M1 and M2 macrophages in situ is less understood. Here, we designed an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle-based molecular imaging nanoprobe to quantify the repolarization of M2 to M1 macrophages by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the redox-active nitric oxide (NO) as a vivid chemical target. The nanoprobe equipped with O-phenylenediamine groups could react with the intracellular NO molecules during the repolarization of M2 macrophages to the M1 phenotype, leading to electrical attraction and colloidal aggregation of the nanoprobes. Consequently, the prominent changes of the T1 and T2 relaxation in MRI allow for the quantification of the macrophage polarization. In a 4T1 breast cancer model, the MRI nanoprobe was able to reveal macrophage polarization and predict treatment efficiency in both immunotherapy and radiotherapy paradigms.

Real-time atomic-scale imaging visualizes particle reshaping and increased graphitization of the carbon support upon heating of Ir/C in vacuum. According to in situ TEM results, carbon overcoating grows over Ir NPs during the heating process, starting from ca. 550 °C. With the carbon overlayers formed, no sintering and migration of Ir NPs is observed at 800 °C, yet the initial Ir NPs sinter at or below 550 °C, i.e., at a temperature associated with an incomplete particle encapsulation. The carbon overlayer corrugates when the temperature is decreased from 800 to 200 °C and this process is associated with the particle surface reconstruction and is reversible, such that the corrugated carbon overlayer can be smoothed out by increasing the temperature back to 800 °C. The catalytic performance (activity and stability) of the encapsulated Ir NPs in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is higher than that of the initial (nonencapsulated) state of Ir/C.

Herein, we introduce a versatile hybrid hydrogel (SQPV) composed of silk fibroin and chitosan, which exhibits spatiotemporal properties for drug release.

This double network approach results in a material with exceptional anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and proliferative stimulation and tissue remodeling regulation capabilities. Furthermore, SQPV showcases mechanical strength and transparency akin to those of native cornea.

Taking advantage of this unique targeting function, aptamers have been extensively applied to bioanalysis and disease theranostics. However, the targeting functionality of aptamers in the physiological milieu is greatly impeded compared with their in vitro applications. To investigate the physiological factors that adversely affect the in vivo targeting ability of aptamers, we herein systematically studied the interactions between human plasma proteins and aptamers and the specific effects of plasma proteins on aptamer targeting. Microscale thermophoresis and flow cytometry analysis showed that plasma interacted with aptamers, restricting their affinity toward targeted tumor cells. Further pull-down assay and proteomic identification verified that the interactions between aptamers and plasma proteins were mainly involved in complement activation and immune response as well as showed structure-selective and sequence-specific features. Particularly, the fibronectin 1 (FN1) protein showed dramatically specific interactions with nucleolin (NCL) targeting aptamer AS1411. The competitive binding between FN1 and NCL almost deprived the AS1411 aptamer’s targeting ability in vivo. In order to maintain the targeting function in the physiological milieu, a series of optimizations were performed via the chemical modifications of AS1411 aptamer, and 3′-terminal pegylation was demonstrated to be resistant to the interaction with FN1, leading to improved tumor-targeting effects. This work emphasizes the physiological environment influences on aptamers targeting functionality and suggests that rational design and modification of aptamers to minimize the nonspecific interaction with plasma proteins might be effective to maintain aptamer functionality in future clinical uses.","2023-12-12","2024-07-04 22:19:20","2024-07-06 00:01:23","2024-07-04 22:19:01","24329-24342","","23","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/FCM2MKX8/Liu et al. - 2023 - Investigation of the Relationship between Aptamers.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Peptide-conjugated PLGA-PEG-MAL nanoparticles encapsulated calcitriol, which acted as an immunoregulatory agent, and were termed calcitriol-loaded nanoparticles (CLNP). CLNP had a ∼200 nm hydrodynamic diameter with a low polydispersity index. In vitro, CLNP induced phenotypic changes in bone marrow derived dendritic cells (DC), reducing the expression of costimulatory and major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, and proinflammatory cytokines. Bulk RNA sequencing of DC showed that CLNP enhanced expression of Ctla4, a gene associated with downregulation of immune responses. In vivo, CLNP accumulated in the proximal lymph nodes after intramuscular injection. Administration of CLNP was not associated with changes in peripheral blood cell numbers or cytokine levels. In the collagen-induced arthritis and SKG mouse models of autoimmune joint disorders, CLNP reduced clinical scores, prevented bone erosion, and preserved cartilage proteoglycan, as assessed by high-resolution microcomputed tomography and histomorphometry analysis. The disease protective effects were associated with increased CTLA-4 expression in joint-localized DC and CD4+ T cells but without generalized suppression of T cell-dependent immune response. The results support the potential of CLNP as modulators of disease flares in autoimmune arthropathies.","2024-01-23","2024-07-04 22:19:20","2024-07-04 23:15:28","2024-07-04 22:19:09","1892-1906","","3","18","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/DCX9ERBX/Johnson et al. - 2024 - Immunomodulatory Nanoparticles for Modulating Arth.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction is commonly employed for this purpose, it has difficulty unambiguously differentiating between the ferroelectric phase and other metastable phases that may exist due to similarities in the d-spacings, their low intensities, and the overlapping of reflections. Infrared signatures provide an alternative route. However, their use in phase identification remains limited because phase control has overwhelmingly been accomplished via substituents, thereby convoluting infrared signatures between the substituents and the phase changes that they induce. Herein, we report the infrared optical responses of three undoped hafnium oxide films where annealing conditions have been used to create films consisting primarily of the ferroelectric polar orthorhombic Pca21, antipolar orthorhombic Pbca, and monoclinic P21/c phases, as was confirmed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV–visible optical properties, and electrical property measurements. Vibrational signatures acquired from synchrotron nano-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (nano-FTIR) are shown to be capable of differentiating between the phases in a nondestructive, rapid, and nanoscale manner. The utility of nano-FTIR is illustrated for a film exhibiting an antiferroelectric polarization response. In this sample, it is proven that this behavior results from the Pbca phase rather than the often-cited tetragonal phase. By demonstrating that IR spectroscopy can unambiguously distinguish phases in this material, this work establishes a tool needed to isolate the factors dictating the ferroelectric phase stability in HfO2-based materials.","2023-12-12","2024-07-04 22:19:20","2024-07-06 00:03:19","2024-07-04 22:19:10","23944-23954","","23","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/KGQVW6XN/Jaszewski et al. - 2023 - Infrared Signatures for Phase Identification in Ha.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are a promising target for hepatic fibrogenesis due to their pivotal role in disease progression. Our previous research has demonstrated the potential of Dihydrotanshinone I (DHI), a lipophilic component derived from the natural herb Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, in treating liver fibrosis by inhibiting the YAP/TEAD2 interaction in HSCs. However, the clinical application of DHI faces challenges due to its poor aqueous solubility and lack of specificity for HSCs. Additionally, recent studies have implicated the impact of liver microbiota, distinct from gut microbiota, on the pathogenesis of liver diseases. In this study, we have developed an HSC- and microbiome-specific delivery system for DHI by conjugating prebiotic-like cyclodextrin (CD) with vitamin A, utilizing PEG2000 as a linker (VAP2000@CD). Our results demonstrate that VAP2000@CD markedly enhances the cellular uptake in human HSC line LX-2 and enhances the deposition of DHI in the fibrotic liver in vivo. Subsequently, intervention with DHI-VAP2000@CD has shown a notable reduction in bile duct-like structure proliferation, collagen accumulation, and the expression of fibrogenesis-associated genes in rats subjected to bile duct ligation. These effects may be attributed to the regulation of the YAP/TEAD2 interaction. Importantly, the DHI-VAP2000@CD intervention has also restored microbial homeostasis in the liver, promoting the amelioration of liver inflammation.

The combined administration of oxymatrine (Om) and astragaloside IV (As) can increase the levels of TILs by inhibiting the activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and improve the activity of TILs by enhancing their mitochondrial function. In the present study, we constructed a magnetic metal–organic framework (MOF)-based nanoplatform with platelet membrane (Pm) coating (PmMN@Om&As) to simultaneously deliver Om and As into the HCC microenvironment.

Furthermore, it can target HCC tissues in a magnetic field and exert long-lasting effects. The HCC microenvironment accelerated the disintegration of PmMN@Om&As and the release of Om&As, thereby increasing the level and activity of TILs by regulating CAFs and the mitochondrial function of TILs. In addition, the carrier could synergize with Om&As by enhancing the oxygen consumption rate and proton efflux rate of TILs, thereby upregulating the mitochondrial function of TILs.

Complete surgical resection is often impossible, and systemically delivered drugs cannot achieve adequate tumor exposure to prevent local recurrence. Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) offers a method for administering therapeutics directly into brain tumor tissue, but its impact has been limited by rapid clearance and off-target cellular uptake. Nanoparticle (NP) encapsulation presents a promising strategy for extending the retention time of locally delivered therapies while specifically targeting glioblastoma cells. However, the brain’s extracellular structure poses challenges for NP distribution due to its narrow, tortuous pores and a harsh ionic environment. In this study, we investigated the impact of NP surface chemistry using layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly to design drug carriers for broad spatial distribution in brain tissue and specific glioblastoma cell targeting. We found that poly-l-glutamate and hyaluronate were effective surface chemistries for targeting glioblastoma cells in vitro. Coadsorbing either polymer with a small fraction of PEGylated polyelectrolytes improved the colloidal stability without sacrificing cancer cell selectivity. Following CED in vivo, gadolinium-functionalized LbL NPs enabled MRI visualization and exhibited a distribution volume up to three times larger than liposomes and doubled the retention half-time up to 13.5 days. Flow cytometric analysis of CED-treated murine orthotopic brain tumors indicated greater cancer cell uptake and reduced healthy cell uptake for LbL NPs compared to nonfunctionalized liposomes. The distinct cellular outcomes for different colayered LbL NPs provide opportunities to tailor this modular delivery system for various therapeutic applications.","2023-12-12","2024-07-04 22:21:27","2024-07-05 23:58:05","2024-07-04 22:19:47","24154-24169","","23","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/498TGAQ2/Pickering et al. - 2023 - Layer-by-Layer Polymer Functionalization Improves .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have designed a camouflaged Fe3O4@HfO2 composite nanoreactor (FHCM), which combines a chemodynamic therapeutic agent Fe3O4 and a radiosensitizer HfO2 that both has passed clinical trials and was inspired by a cell membrane biomimetic technique. FHCM is employed as conceived radiotherapy-adjuvant chemodynamic synergistic therapy of malignant tumors, which has undergone dual scrutiny from both the physical and biological aspects. Experimental results obtained at different levels, including theory, material characterizations, and in vitro and in vivo verifications, suggest that FHCM effectively impaired tumor cells through physical and molecular biological mechanisms involving a HfO2–Fe3O4 photoelectron–electron transfer chain and DNA damage-ferroptosis-immunity chain. It is worth noting that compared to single therapies such as only chemodynamic therapy or radiotherapy, FHCM-mediated radiotherapy-adjuvant chemodynamic synergistic therapy exhibits stronger tumor inhibition efficacy. It significantly addresses the inherent limitations of chemodynamic therapy and radiotherapy and underscores the feasibility and importance of using existing clinical weapons, such as radiotherapy, as auxiliary strategies to overcome certain flaws of emerging antitumor therapeutics like chemodynamic therapy.","2023-12-12","2024-07-04 22:21:27","2024-07-05 23:59:58","2024-07-04 22:19:48","24170-24186","","23","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/JI7PUM7L/Lu et al. - 2023 - Camouflaged Nanoreactors Mediated Radiotherapy-Adj.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The observed CPLE and CD are attributed to the chirality induced by the template in the originally nonchiral 2D HOIP.

Specifically, Gd-labeled DNA1 (DNA1-Gd) and cyclodextrin-coated magnetic nanoparticles (MNP-CD) were employed as enhancer and quencher of MRET, respectively, while DNA2, an azobenzene (Azo) group-modified aptamer (AS1411), served as a linker between enhancer and quencher to construct the MRET probe of MNP@DNA(1–2)-Gd. In tumor tissues with high-level AzoR, the T1-weighted magnetic resonance signal of the MRET probe could be restored by intelligently regulating the switch from “OFF” to “ON” after activation with AzoR, thus accurately indicating the location of the tumor accurately. Moreover, the tumor with a 4 times smaller size than that of the normal tumor model could be imaged based on the proposed MRET probe. The as-proposed MRET-based magnetic resonance imaging strategy not only achieves tumor imaging accurately but also shows promise for early diagnosis of tumors, which might improve patients’ survival rates and provide an opportunity for image-guided biomedical applications in the future.","2023-12-12","2024-07-04 22:21:27","2024-07-06 00:03:49","2024-07-04 22:19:51","24384-24394","","23","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/UTQ2DZY6/Gu et al. - 2023 - Azo Reductase Activated Magnetic Resonance Tuning .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For unresectable tumors adjacent to vital organs or nerves, eliminating local cancer pain without adverse effects remains a formidable challenge. Interventional ablative therapies (IATs), such as radio frequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation, and irreversible electroporation, have been clinically adopted to treat various carcinomas. In this study, we established another palliative interventional therapy to eliminate local cancer pain, instead of relieving nociception temporarily. Here, we developed another interventional ablative therapy (termed nanoparticle-mediated microknife ablation) to locoregionally eliminate cancer pain and tumors. The IAT system was composed of self-assembled nanodrugs, infusion catheters, puncture needles, injection pump, and an empirical tumor ablation formula. Notably, the ablation formula established in the IAT system enables us to predict the essential nanoparticle (NP) numbers used for completely destroying tumors. In a mouse model of cancer pain, tumor-targeted nanodrugs made of Paclitaxel and Hematoporphyrin, which have an extremely high drug-loading efficiency (more than 60%), were infused into tumors through injection pumps under imaging guidance. In conclusion, when compared to classic chemotherapeutic agents, IAT showed significantly higher effectiveness in cancer pain removal. It also presented no damage to the nervous, sensory, and motor capabilities of the treated mice. All of these merits resulted from NPs’ long-lasting retention, targeted ablation, and confined diffusion in tumor stroma.

Herein, we develop a sodium alginate hydrogel consisting of elesclomol-Cu and galactose to induce persistent cuproptosis, leading to the reduction of PD-L1 for radio-immunotherapy of colon tumors. First, a prefabricated hydrogel is synthesized by immobilizing elesclomol onto a sodium alginate saccharide chain through the coordination with bivalent copper ions (Cu2+), followed by incorporation of galactose. After implantation into the tumors, this prefabricated hydrogel can be further cross-linked in the presence of physiological calcium ions (Ca2+), resulting in the formation of a hydrogel with controlled release of elesclomol-Cu2+ (ES-Cu) and galactose. The hydrogel effectively induces the oligomerization of DLAT and cuproptosis in colorectal cancer cells. Interestingly, radiation-induced PD-L1 upregulation is abrogated in the presence of the hydrogel, releasing ES-Cu and galactose.

Despite their transformative use in healthcare, antivirals have been clinically approved to treat only 10 of the more than 200 known pathogenic human viruses. Additionally, many virus functions are intimately coupled with host cellular processes, which presents challenges in antiviral development due to the limited number of clear targets per virus, necessitating extensive insight into these molecular processes. Compounding this challenge, many viral pathogens have evolved to evade effective antivirals. We hypothesize that a viral attachment blocking chimera (VirABloC) composed of a viral binder and a bulky scaffold that sterically blocks interactions between a viral particle and a host cell may be suitable for the development of antivirals that are agnostic to the extravirion epitope that is being bound. We test this hypothesis by modifying a nanobody that specifically recognizes a nonessential epitope presented on the extravirion surface of pseudorabies virus strain 486 with a 3-dimensional wireframe DNA origami structure ∼100 nm in diameter. The nanobody switches from having no inhibitory properties to 4.2 ± 0.9 nM IC50 when conjugated with the DNA origami scaffold. Mechanistic studies support that inhibition is mediated by the noncovalent attachment of the DNA origami scaffold to the virus particle, which obstructs the attachment of the viruses onto host cells. These results support the potential of VirABloC as a generalizable approach to developing antivirals.","2023-12-12","2024-07-04 22:21:27","2024-07-05 23:57:42","2024-07-04 22:19:57","23317-23330","","23","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/BRQLTDWF/Pradhan et al. - 2023 - Viral Attachment Blocking Chimera Composed of DNA .pdf","","Log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sensors were coupled with a personalized Partial Least-Squares Regression (PLSR) ML to derive unknown BP based on individual pulse characteristics with reasonable accuracy, avoiding the issue of individual variability that was encountered by General PLSR ML or formula algorithms. The cuffless and intelligent design endow this ML-sensor as a highly promising platform for the care and treatments of hypertensive patients.","2023-12-12","2024-07-04 22:21:27","2024-07-05 23:53:02","2024-07-04 22:20:01","24242-24258","","23","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/278GQ788/Yao et al. - 2023 - Personalized Machine Learning-Coupled Nanopillar T.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our previous results have demonstrated that crystallization kinetics is a key factor that determines the occurrence of heteroepitaxial growth, but an in-depth understanding of controlling heteroepitaxy from the perspective of crystallization thermodynamics is yet unknown. Herein, we select crystallizable aliphatic polycarbonates (PxCs) with a different number of methylene groups (xCH2, x = 4, 6, 7, 12) in their repeating units as model polymers to explore the effect of lattice match and core compatibility on the seeded growth behavior. Seeded growth of PxCs-containing homopolymer/block copolymer blend unimers from poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) core-forming seed platelet micelles exhibits distinct crystal growth behavior at subambient temperatures, which is governed by the lattice match and core compatibility. A case of seeded growth with better core compatibility and a smaller lattice mismatch follows epitaxial growth, where the newly created crystal domain has the same structural orientation as the original platelet substrate. In contrast, a case of seeded growth with better core compatibility but a larger lattice mismatch shows nonepitaxial growth with less-defined crystal orientations in the platelet plane. Additionally, a case of seeded growth with poor core compatibility and larger lattice mismatch results in polydisperse platelet micelles, whereby crystal formation is not nucleated from the crystalline substrate. These findings reveal important factors that govern the specific crystal growth during a seeded growth approach by using compositionally distinct cores, which would further guide researchers in designing 2D segmented materials via polymer crystallization approaches.","2023-12-12","2024-07-04 22:21:27","2024-07-05 23:50:30","2024-07-04 22:20:02","24141-24153","","23","17","","ACS Nano","Understanding the Seeded Heteroepitaxial Growth of Crystallizable Polymers","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/3EJNNSH9/Zhu et al. - 2023 - Understanding the Seeded Heteroepitaxial Growth of.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We here design an enzyme-silenced nanosponge that shares a long-term lifespan to reversibly exhale/inhale doxorubicin (DOX) for continuous intercellular relay delivery and improved intratumoral retention. The nanosponge is composed of a cationic lipid overlaying a hyaluronic acid derivative polyampholyte core for enveloping of DOX and hyaluronidase-1-targeted siRNA (siHyal1), and a lipoprotein shell decorated with fusion peptide 4F-tLyP-1 that was fused with apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) mimetic peptide 4F and tLyP-1 for tumor homing and extravasation into the tumor interstitium. Triggered by the intra/intercellular pH variation, the nanosponge core could reversibly swell in endo/lysosome (pH 5.0) for DOX release. Owing to the deprotonation, the nanosponge core shrinks back in cytoplasm (pH 7.4) for DOX reloading and continues the behavior after being secreted to the extracellular matrix (pH 6.8) via Golgi apparatus, which dramatically improves intratumoral DOX retention and availability. Concurrently, the intratumoral lifespan of the nanosponge is prolonged by siHyal1-specific silencing, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency of carrier and drug when shuttling multilayer tumor cells. As a result, the nanosponge achieves efficient tumor inhibition in 99.1% of tumor spheroids and 80.1% of orthotopic tumor models. Collectively, this study provides an intelligent nanosponge design for active intercellular relay drug delivery, achieving improved intratumoral bioavailability of drugs and amplified chemotherapy on solid tumors.","2023-12-12","2024-07-04 22:21:27","2024-07-05 23:53:15","2024-07-04 22:20:03","23568-23583","","23","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/45KLJA8I/Yang et al. - 2023 - Enzyme-Silenced Nanosponges Prolong Intratumoral L.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In comparison to previous variants, Omicron S presents additional binding sites as well as a more positive surface charge. These changes hint at additional molecular targets for interactions between virus and cell, such as the cell membrane or proteoglycans on the cell surface. Herein, bottom-up assembled synthetic SARS-CoV-2 miniviruses (MiniVs), with a lipid composition similar to that of infectious particles, are implemented to study and compare the binding properties of Omicron and Alpha variants. Toward this end, a systematic functional screening is performed to study the binding ability of Omicron and Alpha S proteins to ACE2-functionalized and nonfunctionalized planar supported lipid bilayers. Moreover, giant unilamellar vesicles are used as a cell membrane model to perform competitive interaction assays of the two variants. Finally, two cell lines with and without presentation of the ACE2 receptor are used to confirm the binding properties of the Omicron and Alpha MiniVs to the cellular membrane.

In addition, the mass spectrometry titration (MST) method is used to quantify the evolution of inactive lithium components, including dead lithium, solid electrolyte interface (SEI), and lithium hydride (LiH). Combined SS NMR and MST results show that the morphology of lithium metal is reasonably correlated to the amount of inactive Li formed. At low/ambient temperature, the lithium microstructure has a similar evolution pattern, and its poor morphology leads to a large amount of dead lithium, which dominates capacity loss; however, at high temperature large and dense lithium deposits form with less dead Li detected, and the intensified electrolyte consumption in SEI formation is the major cause for capacity loss.

Herein, inspired by honeycomb architecture, we demonstrate an effective and scalable route based on interfacial polymerization (IP) to generate flexible and ordered covalent organic network (CON) membranes for liquid-phase molecular separations. The aperture size of a CON membrane can be reasonably designed through the strong covalent bond between molecular building blocks. The fabricated CON membrane formed by IP showed an obviously size-dependent sieving of molecules, yielding a stepwise conversion from low rejection to the expected high rejection. Moreover, the CON membrane was also found to have the sieving capability for tetracycline and ciprofloxacin, ascribed to the effect of size exclusion by an ordered single-nanoscale channel (<1 nm). This approach provides a viable strategy for creating target-sized channels from molecular-level design and demonstrates their potential for accurate molecular separations.","2023-11-28","2024-07-04 22:21:27","2024-07-06 00:08:17","2024-07-04 22:20:15","22916-22927","","22","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/RUR6AFM5/Yao et al. - 2023 - Flexible Covalent Organic Network with Ordered Hon.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conventional InAs CQD synthesis requires highly reactive, hazardous arsenic precursors, which are commercially scarce, making the synthesis hard to control and study.

The SERS spectra effectively capture multitiered surface biochemical insights including ensemble surface characteristics, e.g., charge and biochemical profiles, and molecular-level information, e.g., types and numbers of functional groups.

Among them, M2-type macrophages have double-edged effects regarding anti-inflammatory effects and tissue repair. Depending on the polarization of the M2 subtypes (M2a or M2c) in the diseased microenvironment, they can either mediate normal tissue repair or drive tissue fibrosis. In renal fibrosis, M2a promotes disease progression through macrophage-to-myofibroblast transition (MMT) cells, while M2c possesses potent anti-inflammatory functions and promotes tissue repair, and is inhibited. The mechanisms underlying this differentiation are complex and are currently not well understood. Therefore, in this study, we first confirmed that M2a-derived MMT cells are responsible for the development of renal fibrosis and demonstrated that the intensity of TGF-β signaling is a major factor determining the differential polarization of M2a and M2c. Under excessive TGF-β stimulation, M2a undergoes a process known as MMT cells, whereas moderate TGF-β stimulation favors the polarization of M2c phenotype macrophages. Based on these findings, we employed targeted nanotechnology to codeliver endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) inhibitor (Ceapin 7, Cea or C) and conventional glucocorticoids (Dexamethasone, Dex or D), precisely modulating the ATF6/TGF-β/Smad3 signaling axis within macrophages. This approach calibrated the level of TGF-β stimulation on macrophages, promoting their polarization toward the M2c phenotype and suppressing excessive MMT polarization.

To explore whether stem cell aging will affect the osteointegration effect of titanium implant, a widely used micronano titanium (MNT) was fabricated. We first verified the expected osteointegration effect of the MNT, which could be attributed to the improvement of stem cell adhesion and osteogenic differentiation. Then, we obtained aged-derived bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and studied their biological behaviors on MNT both in vitro and in vivo. We found that compared with normal rats, MNT did not significantly improve the osteointegration in aged rats. Compared with normal rats, fewer endogenous stem cells were observed at the implant–host interface, and the expression of p21 (senescence marker) was also higher. We further confirmed that MNT promoted the nuclear localization of NF-κB in senescent stem cells through the activation of p38 MAPK, thereby inducing the occurrence of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and ultimately leading to the depletion of the stem-cell pool at the implant–host interface. However, the activation of p38 MAPK can still promote the osteogenic differentiation of nonsenescent BMSCs.

However, detecting α-Syn in CSF and blood is challenging due to its heterogeneous protein size and shape, and low abundance in clinical samples. Nanopore technology offers a promising route for the detection of single proteins in solution; however, the method often lacks the necessary selectivity in complex biofluids, where multiple background biomolecules are present. We address these limitations by developing a strategy that combines nanopore-based sensing with molecular carriers that can specifically capture α-Syn oligomers with sizes of less than 20 nm. We demonstrate that α-Synuclein oligomers can be detected directly in clinical samples, with minimal sample processing, by their ion current characteristics and successfully utilize this technology to differentiate cohorts of PD patients from healthy controls.

The carrier-free drug delivery system with easy preparation and high drug-loading capability is proposed subsequently as a potential strategy to develop the clinical use of hydrophobic drugs.

The IR780-based homodimers could self-assemble to form nanoparticles (DC-NP, DS-NP, DSe-NP) and exhibited higher reactive oxygen species generation capability and photostability than free IR780, in which DSe-NP with 808 nm laser irradiation performed best and resulted in the strongest cytotoxicity to 4T1 cells. Meanwhile, the glutathione consumption ability of DSe-NP boosted its PDT effect and then induced excessive oxidative stress of 4T1 cells, increasing antitumor efficacy by enhancing immunogenic cell death further. In tumor-bearing mice, DSe-NP displayed obvious tumor site accumulation, which obviously inhibited tumor growth and metastasis, and enhanced the immunological effect by effectively inducing dendritic cells to mature and activating T lymphocytes and natural killer cells.

Both in vitro and in vivo antineoplastic results confirm the superiority of HCS-FeCu nanozyme-induced pyroptosis. Moreover, the mild photothermal-activated pyroptosis combining anti-PD-1 can enhance antitumor immunotherapy. Theoretical calculations further indicate that the mild photothermal stimulation generates high-energy electrons and enhances the interaction between the HCS-FeCu surface and adsorbed oxygen, facilitating molecular oxygen activation, which improves the ROS production efficiency.

Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) residing in the crypts are crucial for maintaining the intestinal epithelium’s homeostasis and promoting regeneration upon injury. However, the precise role of DGCR8, a critical component in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis, in intestinal regeneration remains poorly understood. In this study, we provide compelling evidence demonstrating the indispensable role of epithelial miRNAs in the regeneration of the intestine in mice subjected to 5-FU or irradiation-induced injury. Through a comprehensive pooled screen of miRNA function in Dgcr8-deficient organoids, we observe that the loss of the miR-200 family leads to the hyperactivation of the p53 pathway, thereby reducing ISCs and impairing epithelial regeneration. Notably, downregulation of the miR-200 family and hyperactivation of the p53 pathway are verified in colonic tissues from patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC).

It is vital and challenging to find a nanocarrier with an appropriate affinity toward RBCs and bacteria for selective hitchhiking and release that determines the drug delivery efficiency and specificity. Herein, we report a zwitterionic polymer poly(2-(N-oxide-N,N-diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (OPDEA)-based micelle, which can hitchhike on RBCs in blood and preferentially release in the infection site. We found that OPDEA could bind to the RBCs cell membrane via phospholipid-related affinity and transfer to Gram-positive bacteria due to nearly an order of magnitude stronger interaction with the bacteria cell wall. The zwitterionic surface and cell-wall affinity of OPDEA-based micelles also promote their penetration in biofilm. The clarithromycin-loaded OPDEA micelles show efficient drug delivery into the infection site, resulting in excellent therapeutic performance in both peritonitis and pneumonia models by intravenous or spray administration.

In spite of being a priority eye disease for its high incidence in the elderly, no effective treatments for AMD exist. While systemic administration of antioxidants has been unsuccessful in slowing down degeneration, locally administered rare-earth nanoparticles were shown to be effective in preventing retinal photo-oxidative damage. However, because of inherent problems of dispersion in biological media, limited antioxidant power, and short lifetimes, these NPs are still confined to the preclinical stage. Here we propose platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs), potent antioxidant nanozymes, as a therapeutic tool for AMD. PtNPs exhibit high catalytic activity at minimal concentrations and protect primary neurons against oxidative insults and the ensuing apoptosis. We tested the efficacy of intravitreally injected PtNPs in preventing or mitigating light damage produced in dark-reared albino Sprague–Dawley rats by in vivo electroretinography (ERG) and ex vivo retina morphology and electrophysiology. We found that both preventive and postlesional treatments with PtNPs increased the amplitude of ERG responses to light stimuli. Ex vivo recordings demonstrated the selective preservation of ON retinal ganglion cell responses to light stimulation in lesioned retinas treated with PtNPs. PtNPs administered after light damage significantly preserved the number of photoreceptors and inhibited the inflammatory response to degeneration, while the preventive treatment had a milder effect. The data indicate that PtNPs can effectively break the vicious cycle linking oxidative stress, degeneration, and inflammation by exerting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. The increased photoreceptor survival and visual performances in degenerated retinas, together with their high biocompatibility, make PtNPs a potential strategy to cure AMD.","2023-11-28","2024-07-04 22:21:27","2024-07-06 00:15:57","2024-07-04 22:20:32","22800-22820","","22","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/WT3H6DA2/Cupini et al. - 2023 - Platinum Nanozymes Counteract Photoreceptor Degene.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome serves as a checkpoint in innate and adaptive immunity, promoting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis. As a highly inflammatory form of cell death distinct from apoptosis, pyroptosis can trigger immunogenic cell death and promote systemic immune responses in solid tumors. Previous studies proposed that NLRP3 was activated by translocation to the mitochondria. However, a recent authoritative study has challenged this model and proved that the Golgi apparatus might be a prerequisite for the activation of NLRP3. In this study, we first developed a Golgi apparatus-targeted photodynamic strategy to induce the activation of NLRP3 by precisely locating organelles. We found that Golgi apparatus-targeted photodynamic therapy could significantly upregulate NLRP3 expression to promote the subsequent release of intracellular proinflammatory contents such as IL-1β or IL-18, creating an inflammatory storm to enhance innate immunity. Moreover, this acute NLRP3 upregulation also activated its downstream classical caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis to enhance tumor immunogenicity, triggering adaptive immunity. Pyroptosis eventually led to immunogenic cell death, promoted the maturation of dendritic cells, and effectively activated antitumor immunity and long-lived immune memory. Overall, this Golgi apparatus-targeted strategy provided molecular insights into the occurrence of immunogenic pyroptosis and offered a platform to remodel the tumor microenvironment.","2023-11-14","2024-07-04 22:21:27","2024-07-06 00:31:01","2024-07-04 22:20:42","21153-21169","","21","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/D66XECQ7/Hu et al. - 2023 - Golgi Apparatus-Targeted Photodynamic Therapy for .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Steroid sex hormones such as progesterone (P4) and β-estradiol (E2) are crucial for female wellness and reproduction; however, their concentrations in saliva can vary down to sub-pM and constantly fluctuate over several orders of magnitude. This remains a major obstacle toward user-friendly and reliable monitoring at home with low-cost flexible biosensors. Herein we introduce a 3D micropyramidal electrode architecture to address such challenges and achieve an ultrasensitive flexible electrochemical immunosensor with sub-fM-level detection capability of salivary sex hormones within a few minutes. This is enabled by micropyramidal electrode arrays consisting of a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) thin film as the coating layer and electrochemically decorated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to improve the antibody immobilization. The enhanced mass transport around the 3D tips provided by the micropyramidal architecture is discovered to improve the detection limit by 3 orders of magnitude, pushing it to as low as ∼100 aM for P4 and ∼20 aM for E2, along with a wide linear range up to μM. Accordingly, these hormones down to sub-fM in >1000-fold-diluted saliva samples can be accurately measured by the printed soft immunosensors, thus allowing at-home testing through simple saliva dilution to minimize the interfering substances instead of centrifugation. Finally, monitoring of the female ovarian hormone cycle of both P4 and E2 is successfully demonstrated based on the centrifuge-free saliva testing during a period of 4 weeks. This ultrasensitive and soft 3D microarchitected electrode design is believed to provide a universal platform for a diverse variety of applications spanning from accurate clinical diagnostics and counselling and in vivo detection of bioactive species to environmental and food quality tracing.","2023-11-14","2024-07-04 22:21:27","2024-07-06 00:28:42","2024-07-04 22:20:45","21935-21946","","21","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/LT2BYVLZ/Li et al. - 2023 - Tip-Enhanced Sub-Femtomolar Steroid Immunosensing .pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the mechanism of swelling of GO membranes exposed to different relative humidity (RH) values and show how this is intimately related to the graphene surface chemistry. We show that the structure of the GO membrane changes while the membrane adsorbs water from the environment and that graphene oxide flakes become charged as the membrane is loaded with water and swells. A detailed comparison between simulation and experimental adsorption data reveals that the flake surface charge drives the water adsorption mechanism at low RH when the membrane topology is still disordered and the internal pores are small and asymmetric. As the membrane is exposed to higher RH (80%), the flake acquires more surface charge as more oxide groups deprotonate, and the pores grow in size, yet maintain their disordered geometry. Only for very high relative humidity (98%) does the membrane undergo structural changes. At this level of humidity, the pores in the membrane become slit-like but the flake surface charge remains constant. Our results unveil a very complex mechanism of swelling and show that a single molecular model cannot fully capture the ever-changing chemistry and morphology of the membrane as it swells.

Therefore, the development of communication techniques employing innate sensory abilities including olfaction related to the cerebral limbic system processing emotions, memories, and recognition has been suggested for reducing the training level and increasing communication efficiency. Here, a skin-integrated and wireless olfactory interface system exploiting arrays of miniaturized odor generators (OGs) based on melting/solidifying odorous wax to release smell is introduced for establishing an advanced communication system between deaf-blind and non-deaf-blind. By optimizing the structure design of the OGs, each OG device is as small as 0.24 cm3 (length × width × height of 11 mm × 10 mm × 2.2 mm), enabling integration of up to 8 OGs on the epidermis between nose and lip for direct and rapid olfactory drive with a weight of only 24.56 g. By generating single or mixed odors, different linked messages could be delivered to a user within a short period in a wireless and programmable way. By adopting the olfactory interface message delivery system, the recognition rates for the messages have been improved 1.5 times that of the touch-based method, while the response times were immensely decreased 4 times.

In this study, we ran a head-to-head comparison between Cas9 mRNA or ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-loaded lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver gene editing tools into epidermal layers of human skin, aiming for in situ gene editing. We observed distinct LNP composition and cell-specific effects such as an extended presence of RNP in slow-cycling epithelial cells for up to 72 h. While obtaining similar gene editing rates using Cas9 RNP and mRNA with MC3-based LNPs (10–16%), mRNA-loaded LNPs proved to be more cytotoxic. Interestingly, ionizable lipids with a pKa ∼ 7.1 yielded superior gene editing rates (55%–72%) in two-dimensional (2D) epithelial cells while no single guide RNA-dependent off-target effects were detectable. Unexpectedly, these high 2D editing efficacies did not translate to actual skin tissue where overall gene editing rates between 5%–12% were achieved after a single application and irrespective of the LNP composition.

In situ STXM measurements were conducted on electrodeposited Cu catalysts under electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) conditions. The study provides detailed, quantitative results about the changes in the morphology and chemical structure of the catalytic nanoparticles as a function of applied potentials. The deposited Cu nanoparticles initially contain both Cu(0) and Cu(I). As an increasingly cathodic potential is applied, the Cu(I) species gradually convert to Cu(0) over the potential range of +0.4 to 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE). During this process, Cu(I) particles of various sizes are converted to metallic Cu at different reaction rates and at slightly different potentials, indicating a degree of heterogeneity in the electrochemical response of discrete particles. At CO2R relevant potentials, only metallic Cu is observed, and the morphology of the particles is fairly stable within the spatial resolution limits of STXM (∼40 nm). We also report in situ STXM studies of a working electrode with relatively thick Cu-based electrodeposits. The spatially resolved chemical analysis identifies that Cu-oxide species can persist under CO2R conditions, but only when the catalytic nanoparticles are electronically isolated from the working electrode and therefore are catalytically irrelevant.

In both the lab and the field, we fed the IAPV-infected bees various doses of jute NCC (JNCC) under carefully controlled conditions.

The metagenome profiling suggested that IAPV infection significantly decreased the abundance of gut core bacteria, while JNCC therapy considerably increased the abundance of the gut core bacteria Snodgrassella alvi and Lactobacillus Firm-4. Subsequent metabolome analysis further revealed that JNCC promoted the biosynthesis of fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids, accelerated the purine metabolism, and then increased the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and the genes involved in the Wnt and apoptosis signaling pathways against IAPV infection. Our results highlighted that JNCC could be considered as a prospective candidate agent against a viral infection.","2023-11-14","2024-07-04 22:21:27","2024-07-06 00:34:37","2024-07-04 22:20:54","21662-21677","","21","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/2HPH6EMH/Deng et al. - 2023 - Jute (Corchorus olitorius L.)

However, the inefficient utilization and conversion of exogenous stimulation, single catalytic modality, and unsatisfactory therapeutic efficiency in the tumor microenvironment (TME) have seriously restricted their further application in tumor therapy. Herein, the heterogeneous carbon nitride-based nanoagent named T-HCN@CuMS was successfully developed, which dramatically improved the efficiency of the tumor therapeutic modality. Benefiting from the donor–acceptor (triazine-heptazine) structure within the heterogeneous carbon nitride nanosheets (HCN) and the construction of interplanar heterostructure with copper loaded metallic molybdenum bisulfide nanosheets (CuMS), T-HCN@CuMS presented a favorable photo-induced catalytic property to generate abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS) under near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation. Besides, the choice of CuMS simultaneously enabled this nanoagent to efficiently catalyze the Fenton-like reaction and trigger cell cuproptosis, a recently recognized regulated cell death mode characterized by imbalanced intracellular copper homeostasis and aggregation of lipoylated mitochondrial proteins. Moreover, upon surface modification with cRGDfk-PEG2k-DSPE, T-HCN@CuMS was prepared and endowed with improved dispersibility and αvβ3 integrins targeting ability. In general, through the rational design, T-HCN@CuMS was facilely prepared and had achieved satisfactory antitumor and antimetastasis outcomes both in vitro and in a high-metastatic orthotopic osteosarcoma model.

We introduced an ion-cross-linked dissipative network into a prefabricated covalent cross-linked network (long-chain polymer network), which was prepared using AuNRs as a specific cross-linker. The ion network was then cross-linked with the long-chain polymer in situ to form a specific network structure, imparting antiswelling and photothermal effects to the hydrogel.

To demonstrate the potential of the hydrogel, we established experimental animal models of oral mucosa ulceration and full-thickness skin defects. In vivo results confirmed that M2-Exos released from the hydrogels played a crucial role in wound closure. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of AuNRs and NIR photothermal effects eradicated bacterial infections in the wound area.

Besides, LN-IMQ decreased the occurrence of lung metastases, being effective against advanced metastases. On the other hand, neoantigen-based cancer vaccine has very low immune responses. Here, we also verified that LN-IMQ can serve as an ideal tumor antigen delivery vector. Cancer cells in vitro treated with chemotherapeutic drugs included multiple neoantigens and high levels of damage-associated molecular patterns, which were then successfully encapsulated in LN-IMQ to obtain a “personalized nanovaccine” with artificially amplified antigenicity and adjuvant properties.

In vitro and in vivo studies showed that TPCA could enter the mitochondria through (3-propylcarboxyl) triphenylphosphine bromide (TPP) and effectively restrict the respiration of tumor cells to reduce tumor hypoxia, thus providing continuous oxygen for enhanced iodinated cyanine dye mediated photodynamic therapy, which could further induce in situ vaccines for ablating the primary tumor directly and inhibiting the tumor metastasis and recurrence. Furthermore, the antitumor mechanism revealed that O2-economizer-based oxygen-boosted PDT elicited immunogenic cancer cell death with enhanced exposure and release of DAMPs and altered the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment with increased recruitment of T cells in tumors, thereby inducing in situ vaccines and provoking the systematic antitumor responses against CT26 tumors. This study will provide innovative approaches for local, abscopal, and metastatic tumor treatment.","2023-11-14","2024-07-04 22:21:27","2024-07-06 00:17:32","2024-07-04 22:21:07","21170-21181","","21","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/D2GSSHEP/Zhao et al. - 2023 - “Closed-Loop” O2-Economizer Induced In Situ Therap.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the distribution and spatial organization changes of immune checkpoints during their interactions at the single-molecule level remain difficult to directly visualize due to the lack of in situ imaging techniques with appropriate spatial and stoichiometric resolution. Herein, we report the direct visualization and quantification of the spatial distribution and organization of CD47 on the bladder tumor cell membrane and SIRPα on the macrophage membrane by using a single-molecule localization imaging technique called quantitative direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (QdSTORM). Results showed that a portion of CD47 and SIRPα was present on cell membranes as heterogeneous clusters of varying sizes and densities prior to activation. Quantitative analyses of the reconstructed super-resolution images and theoretical simulation revealed that CD47 and SIRPα were reorganized into larger clusters upon binding to each other. Furthermore, we found that blocking the immune checkpoint interaction with small-molecule inhibitors or antibodies significantly impacted the spatial clustering behavior of CD47 on bladder tumor cells, demonstrating the promise of our QdSTORM strategy in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying immunotherapy.

In our research, the pH-sensitive sgRNA-I/L@ZS nanosystem delivered imipenem and better released it in infected tissues to synergistically damage bacteria with nanoparticles. Gene editing of the CRISPR-Cas9 nanosystem amplified the synergistic effect by reversing the drug-resistance of imipenem. Nitric oxide, which l-arginine reacted with ROS to produce in cascade reaction and bacterial infection sites, was beneficial to heal the infected tissues and induce bacteria death for further enhancing antibacterial effects. In addition, this nanocomposite influenced host–bacteria interactions and restrained and destroyed biofilms. The sgRNA-I/L@ZS nanosystem, similar to a nanobomb, was a high-efficiency bactericide against CRAB. Eventually, in acute pneumonia and peritonitis mouse models, the sgRNA-I/L@ZS nanosystem could combat bacteria and protect tissues from infection. It had marked suppressive effects on inflammation and promoted healing and proliferation of infected tissues.

Pharmacological inhibition of p38 activation abrogated CNP- but not DWCNT-triggered virus reactivation in vitro, and inhibitor pretreatment of latently infected mice attenuated CNP-exposure-induced pulmonary MHV-68 reactivation. Our findings suggest a crucial contribution of particle-exposure-triggered herpesvirus reactivation for nanomaterial exposure or air pollution related lung emphysema development, and pharmacological p38 inhibition might serve as a protective target to alleviate air pollution related chronic lung disease exacerbations.

This strategy is found to give rise to a physically meaningful and differentiable mapping of the atom positions to a low-dimensional manifold in which the main structural motifs are clearly discriminated and meaningfully ordered. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering on the low-dimensional data proved effective at further splitting the motifs into structural subfamilies characterized by very fine and physically relevant differences such as the presence of specific punctual or planar defects or of atoms with particular coordination features.

Previously reported DC-mode GFET biosensors showed a high sensitivity for sensing biomarkers in solutions with a low salt concentration. However, due to Debye length screening, the sensitivity of the DC-mode GFET biosensors decreases significantly during operation in a physiological fluid such as sweat or interstitial fluid. To overcome the Debye screening length limitation, we report here alternating current (AC) mode heterodyne-based GFET biosensors for sensing neuropeptide-Y (NPY), a key stress biomarker, in artificial sweat at physiologically relevant ionic concentrations. Our AC-mode GFET biosensors show a record ultralow detection limit of 2 × 10–18 M with an extensive dynamic range of 10 orders of magnitude in sensor response to target NPY concentration. The sensors were characterized for various carrier frequencies (ranging from 30 kHz to 2 MHz) of the applied AC voltages and various salt concentrations (10, 50, and 100 mM). Contrary to DC-mode sensing, the AC-mode sensor response increases with an increase in salt concentration in the electrolyte. The sensor response can be further enhanced by tuning the carrier frequency of the applied AC voltage. The optimum response frequency of our sensor is approximately 400–600 kHz for salt concentrations of 50 and 100 mM, respectively. The salt-concentration- and frequency-dependent sensor response can be explained by an electrolyte-gated capacitance model.","2023-11-14","2024-07-04 22:21:27","2024-07-06 00:23:03","2024-07-04 22:21:19","20968-20978","","21","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ERRUACDJ/Sarker et al. - 2023 - Label-Free Neuropeptide Detection beyond the Debye.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While it is known that collagen fibrils are mineralized both inside their gap zones (intra-fibrillar mineralization) and on their outer surfaces (extra-fibrillar mineralization), a clear visualization of this architecture in three dimensions (3D), combining structural and compositional information over large volumes, but without compromising the resolution, remains challenging. In this study, we demonstrate the use of on-axis Z-contrast electron tomography (ET) with correlative energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) tomography to examine rod-shaped samples with diameters up to 700 nm prepared from individual osteonal lamellae in the human femur. Our work mainly focuses on two aspects: (i) low-contrast nanosized circular spaces (“holes”) observed in sections of bone oriented perpendicular to the long axis of a long bone, and (ii) extra-fibrillar mineral, especially in terms of morphology and spatial relationship with respect to intra-fibrillar mineral and collagen fibrils. From our analyses, it emerges quite clearly that most “holes” are cross-sectional views of collagen fibrils. While this had been postulated before, our 3D reconstructions and reslicing along meaningful two-dimensional (2D) cross-sections provide a direct visual confirmation. Extra-fibrillar mineral appears to be composed of thin plates that are interconnected and span over several collagen fibrils, confirming that mineralization is cross-fibrillar, at least for the extra-fibrillar phase. EDX tomography shows mineral signatures (Ca and P) within the gap zones, but the signal appears weaker than that associated with the extra-fibrillar mineral, pointing toward the existence of dissimilarities between the two types of mineralization.","2023-12-26","2024-07-04 22:21:27","2024-07-05 22:26:02","2024-07-04 22:21:22","24710-24724","","24","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/H3BS9Z6M/Micheletti et al. - 2023 - Ultrastructure and Nanoporosity of Human Bone Show.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, there is a lack of understanding on how to effectively address excessive oxidative stress, dysregulated immune homeostasis, and microbiota dysbiosis within the IBD microenvironment. Herein, we introduce a nanotherapeutic approach, named LBL-CO@MPDA, for IBD treatment. LBL-CO@MPDA is an orally administered formulation that supplies carbon monoxide (CO) for therapeutic purposes. To create the LBL-CO@MPDA nanocomposite, we developed a layer by layer (LBL) self-assembly strategy where we coated chitosan/alginate polyelectrolytes onto the surface of CO prodrug-loaded mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles (CO@MPDA). Benefiting from the negatively charged surface of the LBL coating, it allows for targeted accumulation of LBL-CO@MPDA specifically onto the positively charged inflamed colon lesions through electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, in the oxidative microenvironment of the inflamed colon, the nanotherapeutic system releases CO in a responsive manner. Interestingly, CO@MPDA ameliorates inflammatory conditions by MPDA-mediated ROS-scavenging and CO-mediated immunomodulation. CO-supplying activates heme oxygenase-1, leading to macrophage M2 polarization via the Notch/Hes1/Stat3 signaling pathway, while suppressing the inflammatory response by down-regulating the p38 MAPK and NF-κB (p50/p65) signaling pathways. In the mice model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced IBD, LBL-CO@MPDA effectively reverses the pro-inflammatory microenvironment and restores gut barrier functions through multiple mechanisms, including scavenging oxidative stress, restoring immune homeostasis, and modulating the gut microbiota. Collectively, our findings highlight the promising potential of this innovative nanotherapeutic strategy for the targeted treatment of IBD.","2023-11-14","2024-07-04 22:21:27","2024-07-06 00:19:01","2024-07-04 22:21:23","21116-21133","","21","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/UBSKWJCP/Zhang et al. - 2023 - An Orally-Administered Nanotherapeutics with Carbo.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First we evaluated the transcriptome of tumor cells at the gene level following low-temperature treatment and observed significant enrichment of genes involved in cell cycle and heat response-related signaling pathways. To address this challenge, we have developed an engineering multifunctional nanoplatform that offered an all-in-one strategy for efficient sensitization of low-temperature PTT. Specifically, we utilized MoS2 nanoparticles as the photothermal core to generate low temperature (40–48 °C). The nanoplatform was coated with DPA to load CPT-11 and Fe2+ and was further modified with PEG and iRGD to enhance tumor specificity (MoS2/Fe@CPT-11-PEG-iRGD). Laser- and acid-triggered release of CPT-11 can significantly increase intracellular H2O2 content, cooperate with Fe2+ ions to increase intracellular lipid ROS content, and activate ferroptosis. Furthermore, CPT-11 induced cell cycle arrest in the temperature-sensitive S-phase, and increased lipid ROS levels contributed to the degradation of HSPs protein expression. This synergistic approach could effectively induce tumor cell death by the sensitized low-temperature PTT and the combination of ferroptosis and chemotherapy. Our nanoplatform can also maximize tumor cell eradication and prolong the survival time of tumor-bearing mice in vivo. The multifunctional approach will provide more possibilities for clinical applications of low-temperature PTT and potential avenues for the development of multiple tumor treatments.","2023-10-24","2024-07-04 22:21:27","2024-07-06 00:42:39","2024-07-04 22:21:26","20218-20236","","20","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/LID46IP6/Li et al. - 2023 - All-in-One Engineering Multifunctional Nanoplatfor.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish GBM diagnosis tools to identify the tumor accurately. The clinical relevance of the current liquid biopsy techniques for GBM diagnosis remains mostly undetermined, owing to the challenges posed by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that restricts biomarkers entering the circulation, resulting in the unavailability of clinically validated circulating GBM markers. GBM-specific liquid biopsy for diagnosis and prognosis of GBM has not yet been developed. Here, we introduce extracellular vesicles of GBM cancer stem cells (GBM CSC-EVs) as a previously unattempted, stand-alone GBM diagnosis modality. As GBM CSCs are fundamental building blocks of tumor initiation and recurrence, it is desirable to investigate these reliable signals of malignancy in circulation for accurate GBM diagnosis. So far, there are no clinically validated circulating biomarkers available for GBM. Therefore, a marker-free approach was essential since conventional liquid biopsy relying on isolation methodology was not viable. Additionally, a mechanism capable of trace-level detection was crucial to detecting the rare GBM CSC-EVs from the complex environment in circulation. To break these barriers, we applied an ultrasensitive superlattice sensor, self-functionalized for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), to obtain holistic molecular profiling of GBM CSC-EVs with a marker-free approach. The superlattice sensor exhibited substantial SERS enhancement and ultralow limit of detection (LOD of attomolar 10–18 M concentration) essential for trace-level detection of invisible GBM CSC-EVs directly from patient serum (without isolation). We detected as low as 5 EVs in 5 μL of solution, achieving the lowest LOD compared to existing SERS-based studies. We have experimentally demonstrated the crucial role of the signals of GBM CSC-EVs in the precise detection of glioblastoma. This was evident from the unique molecular profiles of GBM CSC-EVs demonstrating significant variation compared to noncancer EVs and EVs of GBM cancer cells, thus adding more clarity to the current understanding of GBM CSC-EVs. Preliminary validation of our approach was undertaken with a small amount of peripheral blood (5 μL) derived from GBM patients with 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity. Identification of the signals of GBM CSC-EV in clinical sera specimens demonstrated that our technology could be used for accurate GBM detection. Our technology has the potential to improve GBM liquid biopsy, including real-time surveillance of GBM evolution in patients upon clinical validation. This demonstration of liquid biopsy with GBM CSC-EV provides an opportunity to introduce a paradigm potentially impacting the current landscape of GBM diagnosis.","2023-10-24","2024-07-04 22:24:05","2024-07-06 00:40:21","2024-07-04 22:22:24","19832-19852","","20","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/GTB84RKU/Premachandran et al. - 2023 - Self-Functionalized Superlattice Nanosensor Enable.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therapeutic manipulation of TAM could therefore improve clinical outcomes and synergize with immunotherapy and other cancer therapies. While different nanocarriers have been used to target TAM, a knowledge gap exists on which TAM pathways to target and what payloads to deliver for optimal antitumor effects. We hypothesized that a multipart combination involving the Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK), noncanonical nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), and toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways could lead to a highly active myeloid therapy (HAMT). Thus, we devised a screen to determine drug combinations that yield maximum IL-12 production from myeloid cells to treat the otherwise highly immunosuppressive myeloid environments in tumors. Here we show the extraordinary efficacy of a triple small-molecule combination in a TAM-targeted nanoparticle for eradicating murine tumors, jumpstarting a highly efficient antitumor response by adopting a distinctive antitumor TAM phenotype and synergizing with other immunotherapies. The HAMT therapy represents a recently developed approach in immunotherapy and leads to durable responses in murine cancer models.","2023-10-24","2024-07-04 22:24:05","2024-07-06 00:45:21","2024-07-04 22:22:26","20666-20679","","20","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/UKKF63C9/Fredrich et al. - 2023 - Highly Active Myeloid Therapy for Cancer.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Generally, the polysaccharide-based hydrogels have suffered from the trade-off between stiffness of the polysaccharide and stretchability due to the inherent nature. Thus, polysaccharide-based hydrogels (polysaccharides act as the matrix) with self-healing properties and excellent stretchability are scarcely reported. Here, a solvent-assisted strategy was developed to construct MXene-mediated cellulose conductive hydrogels with excellent stretchability (∼5300%) and self-healability. MXene (an emerging two-dimensional nanomaterial) was introduced as emerging noncovalent cross-linking sites between the solvated cellulose chains in a benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide aqueous solution. The electrostatic interaction between the cellulose chains and terminal functional groups (O, OH, F) of MXene led to cross-linking of the cellulose chains by MXene to form a hydrogel. Due to the excellent properties of the cellulose–MXene conductive hydrogel, the work not only enabled their strong potential in both fields of electronic skins and energy storage but provided fresh ideas for some other stubborn polymers such as chitin to prepare hydrogels with excellent properties.","2023-10-24","2024-07-04 22:24:05","2024-07-06 00:39:28","2024-07-04 22:22:27","20699-20710","","20","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ED288B5Z/Wan et al. - 2023 - MXene-Mediated Cellulose Conductive Hydrogel with .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), a widely expressed protein in somatic cells, works as a “brake” regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration. Given that this “brake” also works in cell electrical responses, there is a hypothesis that PTEN inhibition may amplify the efficacy of EST in wound treatment. However, long-term inhibition of PTEN may result in DNA damage and reduce DNA repair, which poses a significant challenge to the safe use of PTEN inhibitors. To address this issue, we developed a system that combines PTEN inhibitor loaded electro-responsive hydrogel (BPV@PCP) with a wearable direct current pulse piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG). The PENG converts the rat’s motions into electric fields that synchronously charge the wound edge tissue and BPV@PCP. Electric field intensity was lower when the rat was quiet or anesthetized, which is insufficient to trigger an effective PTEN inhibitor release. However, when the rat was in action, the electric field intensity exceeded 625 mV/mm, resulting in a rapid drug release. This on-demand PTEN inhibition accelerated wound healing by amplifying cell electric responsiveness while avoiding negative effects associated with continuous overinhibition of PTEN. Notably, this system improves vascularization not only by improving endothelial cell electric responsiveness but also through the paracrine pathway, in which electrical stimulation and PTEN inhibition synergically promote VEGF secretion.","2023-10-24","2024-07-04 22:24:05","2024-07-06 00:45:11","2024-07-04 22:22:28","19652-19666","","20","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/SMLUC2UI/Fu et al. - 2023 - A Self-Powered HydrogelNanogenerator System Accel.pdf","","Others","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Targeting of therapeutic nanoparticles (NPs) has been accomplished using a range of targeting moieties including monoclonal antibodies and related fragments, peptides, and small molecules. Here, we investigated a full-length Fn14-specific monoclonal antibody, ITEM4, or an ITEM4-Fab fragment as a targeting moiety to guide the development of a clinical formulation. We formulated NPs with varying densities of the targeting moieties while maintaining the decreased nonspecific adhesivity with receptor targeting (DART) characteristics. To model the conditions that NPs experience following intravenous infusion, we investigated the impact of serum exposure in relation to the targeting moiety type and surface density. To further evaluate performance at the cancer cell level, we performed experiments to assess differences in cellular uptake and trafficking in several cancer cell lines using confocal microscopy, imaging flow cytometry, and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. We observed that Fn14-targeted NPs exhibit enhanced cellular uptake in Fn14-high compared to Fn14-low cancer cells and that in both cell lines uptake levels were greater than observed with control, nontargeted NPs. We found that serum exposure increased Fn14-targeted NP specificity while simultaneously reducing the total NP uptake. Importantly, serum exposure caused a larger reduction in cancer cell uptake over time when the targeting moiety was an antibody fragment (Fab region of the monoclonal antibody) compared with the full-length monoclonal antibody targeting moiety. Lastly, we uncovered that full monoclonal antibody-targeted NPs enter cancer cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and traffic through the endolysosomal pathway.

By reverting activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) to quiescence, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) can attenuate their stromal synthesis and remodel the tumor-promoting microenvironment. However, its modulatory effects have been greatly weakened due to its limited delivery to PSCs. Therefore, we constructed a tripeptide RFC-modified gelatin/oleic acid nanoparticle (RNP@ATRA), which delivered ATRA in an enzyme-triggered popcorn-like manner and effectively resolved the delivery challenges. Specifically, surface RFC was cleaved by aminopeptidase N (APN) on the tumor endothelium to liberate l-arginine, generating nitric oxide (NO) for tumor-specific vasodilation. Then, massive nanoparticles were pushed from the vessels into tumors, showing 5.1- and 4.0-fold higher intratumoral accumulation than free ATRA and APN-inert nanoparticles, respectively. Subsequently, in the interstitium, matrix metalloproteinase-2-induced gelatin degradation caused RNP@ATRA to rapidly release ATRA, promoting its interstitial penetration and PSC delivery. Thus, activated PSCs were efficiently reverted to quiescence, and stroma secretion and vascular compression were reduced, thereby enhancing intratumoral delivery of small-molecule or nanosized chemotherapeutics.

Microneedles are comparatively favorable for self-administered transdermal drug delivery with improved absorption and bioavailability. Due to the cross-scale geometric characteristics, 3D-printed microneedles face a significant trade-off between the feature resolution and production speed in conventional layer-wise deposition sequences. In this study, we introduce an economical and scalable direct ink drawing strategy to create drug-loaded microneedles. A freestanding microneedle is efficiently generated upon each pneumatic extrusion and controlled drawing process. Sharp tips of ∼5 μm are formed with submillimeter nozzles, representing 2 orders of magnitude improved resolution. As the key enabler of this fabrication strategy, the yield-stress fluid inks are formulated by simply filling silica nanoparticles into regular polymer solutions. The approach is compatible with various microneedles based on dissolvable, biodegradable, and nondegradable polymers. Various matrices are readily adopted to adjust the release behaviors of the drug-loaded microneedles. Successful fabrication of multifunctional patches with heterogeneously integrated microneedles allows the treatment of melanoma via synergistic photothermal therapy and combination chemotherapy. The personalized patches are designed for cancer severity to achieve high therapeutic efficacy with minimal side effects.

The sensitive release and great supply capacity are significant indicators of NO donors and their performance. Here, a transition metal nitride (TMN) MoN@PEG is adopted as an efficient NO donor. The release process starts with H+-triggered denitrogen owing to the high electronegativity of the N atom and weak Mo–N bond. Then, these active NHx are oxidized by O2 and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) to form NO, endowing specific release to the tumor microenvironment (TME). With a porous nanosphere structure (80 nm), MoN@PEG does not require an extra carrier for NO delivery, contributing to ultrahigh atomic utilization for outstanding release ability (94.1 ± 5.6 μM). In addition, it can also serve as a peroxidase and sonosensitizer for anticancer treatment. To further improve the charge separation, MoN-Pt@PEG was prepared to enhance the sonodynamic therapy (SDT) effect. Accordingly, ultrasound (US) further promotes NO generation due to more ROS generation, facilitating in situ peroxynitrite (·ONOO–) generation with great cytotoxicity. At the same time, the nanostructure also degrades gradually, leading to high elimination (94.6%) via feces and urine within 14-day. The synergistic NO and chemo-/sono-dynamic therapy brings prominent antitumor efficiency and further activates the immune response to inhibit metastasis and recurrence.

With different mesh sandpapers as templates, TLIG sensors with adjustable sensing properties were achieved. The tactile sensor obtains excellent sensitivity (52260.2 kPa–1 at a range of 0–7 kPa), a broad detection range (up to 1000 kPa), a low limit of detection (65 Pa), a rapid response (response/recovery time of 12/46 ms), and excellent working stability (10000 cycles). Benefiting from TLIG’s high performance and waterproofness, TLIG sensors can be used as health monitors and even in underwater scenarios. TLIG sensors can also be integrated into arrays acting as receptors of the soft robotic gripper.

However, the underlying mechanism governing the influence of hydrophilicity of the microcapsule (MC) core on the evolution of the microcapsule shell remains unclear, posing challenges for encapsulating water-soluble core materials. This study elucidates the microlevel formation mechanism of microcapsules by investigating the impact of interfacial mass transfer on shell formation and proposes a method for regulating the structure of shells. The study reveals that enhancing the hydrophilicity of the core enhances the shuttle effect between the oil and aqueous phase, expands the region of polymerization reactions, and forms a loose and thick shell. The thickness of the microcapsule shell prepared using solvent oil 150# (MCs-SOL) measures only 264 nm, while that of the microcapsules prepared using propylene glycol diacetate and solvent oil 150# at a ratio of 2:1 (MCs-P2S1) is 5.2 times greater. The enhanced compactness of the shell reduced the release rate of microcapsules and the leaching distance of fosthiazate in soil, thereby mitigating the risk of leaching loss and facilitating the distribution of active ingredients within crop roots. The MCs-SOL had a limited leaching distance measurement of 8 cm and exhibited a satisfactory efficacy of 87.3% in controlling root galling nematodes. The thickness and compactness of the MCs shell can be regulated by manipulating the interfacial shuttle effect, providing a promising approach to enhancing utilization efficiency while mitigating potential environmental risks.","2023-10-24","2024-07-04 22:24:05","2024-07-06 00:36:59","2024-07-04 22:22:44","20654-20665","","20","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/2N9XVUFB/Zhang et al. - 2023 - Interfacial Polymerization Depth Mediated by the S.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have attracted broad attention as next-generation therapeutics for promoting tissue regeneration. As a next step toward clinical translation, strategies to manipulate EV effects on downstream cellular targets are needed. Here, we developed an engineering strategy to tune the therapeutic potential of EVs using nanotopographical cues. We found that EVs released by young MPCs cultured on flat substrates (fEVs) promoted the proliferation of aged MPCs while EVs released by MPCs cultured on nanogratings (nEVs) promoted myogenic differentiation. We then employed a bioengineered 3D muscle aging model to optimize the administration protocol and test the therapeutic potential of fEVs and nEVs in a high-throughput manner. We found that the sequential administration first of fEVs during the phase of MPC proliferative expansion (i.e., 1 day after injury) followed by nEV administration at the stage of MPC differentiation (i.e., 3 days after injury) enhanced aged muscle regeneration to a significantly greater extent than fEVs and nEVs delivered either in isolation or mixed. The beneficial effects of the sequential EV treatment strategy were further validated in vivo, as evidenced by increased myofiber size and improved functional recovery. Collectively, our study demonstrates the ability of topographical cues to tune EV therapeutic potential and highlights the importance of optimizing the EV administration strategy to accelerate aged skeletal muscle regeneration.","2023-10-24","2024-07-04 22:24:05","2024-07-06 00:39:13","2024-07-04 22:22:45","19640-19651","","20","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/9GSMQENS/Wang et al. - 2023 - Nanotopographical Cues Tune the Therapeutic Potent.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the presence of TYR, catechol immobilized on MN is preferentially oxidized to benzoquinone, which competitively impedes the interaction of MN and Au@Ag-Pt NPs, triggering the SERS–colorimetric signal reciprocal switch. Using a B16F10 mouse melanoma model, our platform is capable of noninvasively piercing the skin surface and detecting TYR levels before and during anti-PD-1 antibody treatment, which would be highly informative for prognostic judgment and illness monitoring of melanoma. Through in situ sensing for capturing the metabolic changes of TYR in advance, this platform was successfully applied to discriminate the melanoma subjects from skin moles and normal ones (p < 0.001), as well as screen potential melanoma from lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-negative patients. Melanoma growth and prognosis can still be monitored through recording the continuous change of TYR levels.

These PDMMs are pollen grains with half of them covered by a gold (Au) layer, which can result in an asymmetric thermal gradient around the PDMMs under NIR-II irradiation, thereby forming a thermophoretic force to drive PDMMs to move spontaneously. Besides, the inherent spiny and hollow architectures of pollen grains endowed the PDMMs with outstanding capacity of adherence and drug delivery, respectively. Based on these features, we have demonstrated that the PDMMs could move actively in vivo with the irradiation of NIR-II light and adhere to the surrounding tissues for drug delivery.

However, the natural immunosuppressive environment within tumors, known as the tumor microenvironment (TME), hampers the uptake and presentation of antigens by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) within the tumor itself. This limitation results in inadequate activation of immune responses against cancer. In contrast, immune cells in peritumoral tissue maintain their normal functions. In this context, we present an interesting approach to enhance cancer immunotherapy by utilizing engineered photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) and their outer membrane vesicles (OMVPSB) to capture and transport antigens to the outer regions of the tumor. We modified PSB with maleimide (PSB-MAL), which, when exposed to near-infrared (NIR) laser-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT), induced extensive cancer cell death and the release of tumor antigens. Subsequently, the NIR-phototactic PSB-MAL transported these tumor antigens to the peripheral regions of the tumor under NIR laser exposure. Even more intriguingly, PSB-MAL-derived OMVPSB-MAL effectively captured and delivered antigens to tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). This facilitated enhanced antigen presentation by mature and fully functional APCs in the TDLNs. This intricate communication network between PSB-MAL, the OMVPSB-MAL, and APCs promoted the efficient presentation of tumor antigens in the tumor periphery and TDLNs. Consequently, there was a notable increase in the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) into the tumor, triggering potent antitumor immune responses in both melanoma and breast cancer models. This cascade of events resulted in enhanced suppression of tumor metastasis and recurrence, underscoring the robust efficacy of our approach. Our interesting study, harnessing the potential of bacteria and OMVs to redirect tumor antigens for enhanced cancer immunotherapy, provides a promising path toward the development of personalized cancer vaccination strategies.","2023-10-10","2024-07-04 22:24:05","2024-07-06 00:55:02","2024-07-04 22:22:56","18716-18731","","19","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/36XPAYS4/Han et al. - 2023 - Redirecting Antigens by Engineered Photosynthetic .pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

YOR1 exhibited nanoscale phase separation in a film blended with PTB7-Th. Moreover, substituting the BAT unit effectively extended the absorption wavelengths of YOR1 over 1000 nm by efficient intramolecular charge transfer and extension of the conjugation length.

These findings indicate that mechanical ball milling can be employed to strip BN followed by combination with SPI, resulting in a tight bonded interface connection. Subsequently, the adhesive’s dry and wet shear strengths increased by 14.3% and 90.5% to 1.83 and 1.05 MPa, respectively. The resultant adhesive also possesses a good thermal conductivity (0.363 W/mK). Impressively, because hot-pressing helps the resultant adhesive to establish a thermal conduction pathway, the thermal conductivity of the resulting wood-based composite is 10 times higher than that of the SPI adhesive, which shows a thermal conductivity similar to that of ceramic tile and has excellent potential for developing biothermal conductivity materials, geothermal floors, and energy storage materials.

Metabolomics analysis revealed that redox regulation and energy metabolism were two principal mechanisms that were impacted during the process.

The results of essential mineral release suggested that the ZnO QDs treatment increased the bioaccessibility of K, Zn, and Cu by 14.8–35.1% relative to the control. Additionally, both types of ZnO NMs had no negative impact on the α-amylase, pepsin, and trypsin activities.

However, microwave (MW) is not selective against tumors, and residual tumors after incomplete ablation will generate immunosuppression, ultimately making tumors prone to recurrence and metastasis. Herein, a nano-immunomodulator (Bi-MOF-l-Cys@PEG@HA, BMCPH) is proposed to reverse the immunosuppression and reactivate the antitumor immune effect through responsively releasing H2S in tumor cells for improving MWTT. Under MW irradiation, BMCPH will mediate MWTT to ablate tumors and release l-cysteine (l-Cys) to react with the highly expressed cystathionine β-synthase in tumor to generate H2S. The generated H2S can inhibit the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and promote the expression of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Moreover, Bi-MOF can also scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), a major means of MDSCs-mediated immunosuppression, to further weaken the immunosuppressive effect. Simultaneously, the surface-covered HA will gather CTLs around the tumor to enhance the immune response. This nano gas immunomodulator provides an idea for the sensitive and tunable release of unstable gas molecules at tumor sites.

Due to its believed role in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmission, many studies have employed simple, synthetic model systems to investigate alpha-synuclein/membrane interactions in an attempt to gain a better understanding of the protein’s native and pathogenic functions. Interestingly, these studies seem to suggest that alpha-synuclein interacts differently with rigid vesicle mimics in comparison to malleable vesicle mimics. However, the use of different mimic sizes and surface chemistries across existing studies makes it challenging to directly compare the effects of membrane mechanical properties on protein behavior observed thus far. In this work, we developed a synaptic vesicle mimic library comprising a range of both malleable and rigid synaptic vesicle mimics possessing the same size and biologically representative lipid surface chemistry. Limited proteolysis mass spectrometry experiments revealed distinct fragmentation patterns between rigid and malleable synaptic vesicle mimics. The N-terminal and C-terminal regions of alpha-synuclein were found to become less solvent-accessible upon binding to all synaptic vesicle mimics. Nevertheless, minor variations in digestion pattern were observed in the central region of the protein dependent upon mimic size, rigidity, and lipid composition. Higher binding affinities were observed for alpha-synuclein binding to rigid synaptic vesicle mimics compared to malleable synaptic vesicle mimics. Additionally, the binding affinity of alpha-synuclein toward small lipid vesicles and small lipid-coated gold nanoparticles without cholesterol was found to be lower than that of their respective malleable and rigid counterparts. Interestingly, the binding curves for the rigid synaptic vesicle mimics demonstrated a nontraditional peak and dip shape believed to arise from differences in alpha-synuclein orientation on the particle surface at different protein-to-particle incubation ratios.","2023-10-24","2024-07-04 22:24:05","2024-07-06 00:41:57","2024-07-04 22:23:06","20387-20401","","20","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/KB6NG2AH/McClain et al. - 2023 - Biologically Representative Lipid-Coated Gold Nano.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we developed a self-assembled multivalent fluorescence-nanobody (Nb26-EGFP-H6) with 16.5-fold and 30-fold higher affinity and sensitivity than a monovalent nanobody (Nb26). Based on the Nb26-EGFP-H6, we synthesized enhanced immune-probes Zn-CN@Nb26-EGFP-H6 by pyrolyzing and oxidizing an imidazolating zeolite framework-8 (ZIF-8) to obtain photothermal metal–carbon nanomaterials (Zn-CN) for immobilizing Nb26-EGFP-H6. The rough and porous structure of Zn-CN with a large surface area facilitates the enrichment and immobilization of antibodies. A trimodal lateral flow immunoassay (tLFIA) with colorimetric, fluorescent, and photothermal triple signal outputs was constructed for the detection of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in maize. Attractively, the Zn-CN-based tLFIA’s multiplex guarantees accurate and sensitive detection of AFB1, with triple signal detection limits of 0.0012 ng/mL (colorimetric signals), 0.0094 ng/mL (fluorescent signals), and 0.252 ng/mL (photothermal signals). The sensitivity of the trimode immunosensor was 628-fold and 42-fold higher than that of the original Nb26-based ELISA (IC50) and the unimodal LFIA (LOD).

However, simple and effective methods for cancer drug resistance detection at the single-cell level are still lacking in laboratory and clinical studies. Inspired by the fact that nanoparticles with diverse physicochemical properties would generate distinct and specific interactions with drug-resistant and drug-sensitive cancer cells, which have distinctive molecular signatures, here, we have synthesized a library of fluorescent nanoparticles with various sizes, surface charges, and compositions (SiO2 nanoparticles (SNPs), organic PS-co-PAA nanoparticles (ONPs), and ZIF-8 nanoparticles (ZNPs)), thus demonstrating that the composition has a critical influence on the interaction of nanoparticles with drug-resistant cancer cells. Furthermore, the clathrin/caveolae-independent endocytosis of ZNPs together with the P-glycoprotein-related decreased cell membrane fluidity resulted in a lower cellular accumulation of ZNPs in drug-resistant cancer cells, consequently causing the distinct cellular accumulation of ZNPs between the drug-resistant and drug-sensitive cancer cells. This difference was further quantified by detecting the fluorescence signals generated by the accumulation of nanoparticles at the single-cell level via flow cytometry. Our findings provide another insight into the nanoparticle–cell interactions and offer a promising platform for the diagnosis of cancer drug resistance of various cancer cells and clinical cancer samples at the single-cell level.","2023-10-10","2024-07-04 22:24:05","2024-07-06 00:52:28","2024-07-04 22:23:08","19372-19386","","19","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/2HAMS4JS/Liu et al. - 2023 - Single-Cell Diagnosis of Cancer Drug Resistance th.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we developed near-infrared (NIR) aggregated-induced emission (AIE) fluorophore-labeled microplastics (2 μm) and nanoplastics (100 nm) as models of MNPs. This model was based on the NIR-AIE technique with strong emission at the second near-infrared (NIR-IIII) window, which overcomes the interference of autofluorescence and observation artifacts in the detection of commercial fluorescent-labeled particles. Due to its deep tissue penetration and noninvasiveness, the dynamic process of accumulation and transport of MNPs in individuals can be tracked with NIR imaging. We then directly visualized and quantified the uptake and depuration processes of MPs and NPs in zebrafish. The results showed that the MPs and NPs were mainly accumulated in the fish gut, and the distribution was heterogeneous. MPs tended to accumulate more in the fore and mid areas of the gut compared with NPs. Besides, both MPs and NPs could accumulate in large quantities locally in the gut and might cause intestinal obstruction. MNPs accumulated slowly during the initial exposure followed by rapid and sustained accumulation in gut. Based on these kinetic accumulation and depuration, we developed a refined toxicokinetic (TK) model to describe the dynamic changes in the uptake and depuration of MNPs. Overall, this study proposed a MNP model based on the NIR-AIE technique, which provided a reliable tracer technology for the visualization, tracking and quantification of MNPs in vivo.","2023-10-10","2024-07-04 22:24:05","2024-07-06 00:48:46","2024-07-04 22:23:10","19410-19420","","19","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/Y8EJIXKC/Yang et al. - 2023 - Near-Infrared-II In Vivo Visualization and Quantit.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, CSD-HLO in series with Al2O3 improves switching of MOSFETs (with an amorphous oxide channel) based on the negative capacitance effect.

At present, the main therapeutic modalities, such as local mechanical debridement and antibiotic delivery, are not only difficult to solve the intractable bacterial biofilm effectively but also tricky to ameliorate the excessive inflammatory response as well as regenerate the impaired periodontal tissues. Herein, we have proposed the TM/BHT/CuTA hydrogel system formed by the self-assembly of the copper-based nanozyme (copper tannic acid coordination nanosheets, CuTA NSs) and the triglycerol monostearate/2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (TM/BHT) hydrogel. The negatively charged TM/BHT/CuTA can retain at the inflammation sites with a positive charge through electrostatic adsorption and hydrolyze in response to the increasing MMP of periodontitis, realizing the on-demand release of the CuTA nanozyme. The released CuTA nanozyme has antibacterial and antiplaque properties. Meanwhile, as a metal-phenolic nanozyme, it can scavenge multiple ROS by simulating the cascade process of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Further, the CuTA nanozyme can modulate the macrophage polarization from M1 phenotype to M2 phenotype through the Nrf2/NF-κB pathway, which reduces the pro-inflammatory cytokines, increases the anti-inflammatory cytokines, and promotes the expression of osteogenetic genes successively, thus relieving the inflammation and accelerating the tissue regeneration of periodontitis.

In this study, we report on the development of LNPs with an enhanced capability for inducing cellular immunity by using an ionizable lipid with a vitamin E scaffold. An RNA vaccine that contained this ionizable lipid and an IVT-mRNA encoding a model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) induced OVA-specific cytotoxic T cell responses and showed an antitumor effect against an E.G7-OVA tumor model. Vaccination with the LNPs conferred protection against lethal infection by Toxoplasma gondii using its antigen TgPF. The vitamin E scaffold-dependent type I interferon response was important for effector CD8+ T cell differentiation induced by the mRNA-LNPs. Our findings also revealed that conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) were essential for achieving CD8+ T cell responses induced by the mRNA-LNPs, while the XCR1-positive subset of cDCs, cDC1 specialized for antigen cross-presentation, was not required. Consistently, the mRNA-LNPs were found to selectively transfect another subset of cDCs, cDC2 that had migrated from the skin to lymph nodes, where they could make vaccine-antigen-dependent contacts with CD8+ T cells. The findings indicate that the activation of innate immune signaling by the adjuvant activity of the vitamin E scaffold and the expression of antigens in cDC2 are important for subsequent antigen presentation and the establishment of antigen-specific immune responses.","2023-10-10","2024-07-04 22:24:05","2024-07-06 00:52:05","2024-07-04 22:23:17","18758-18774","","19","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/FL2MDJFG/Oyama et al. - 2023 - An Ionizable Lipid Material with a Vitamin E Scaff.pdf","","Log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Isoliquiritigenin (ISL), a compound derived from traditional Chinese medicine, has shown potential as an anti-BC therapy, but its low bioavailability and poor water solubility restrict its effectiveness. In this study, we created theranostic nanoparticles consisting of ISL and a near-infrared (NIR) photosensitizer, TBPI, which displays aggregation-induced emission (AIE), with the goal of providing combined chemo- and photodynamic therapies (PDT) for BC. Initially, we designed an asymmetric organic molecule, TBPI, featuring a rotorlike triphenylamine as the donor and 1-methylpyridinium iodide as the acceptor, which led to the production of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria. We then combined TBPI with ISL and encapsulated them in DSPE-PEG-RGD nanoparticles to produce IT-PEG-RGD nanoparticles, which showed high affinity for BC, better intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency, and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between TBPI and ISL.

The hierarchical porous structure of DB with rich surface silanol groups provides a strong anchored interface effect for BSP, which can significantly enhance cross-linking density and interaction strength of the hydrophilic macromolecular network. BSP/DB adhesive offers 6 times greater mechanical strength and viscosity over BSP under different temperature conditions. The aggregation effect of DBs interface for BSP avoided the washout of BSP/DB adhesive during application in a wet environment before cross-linking occurs. This strengthened the adhesion ability of BSP/DB adhesive to biological tissue that brought out complete sealing hemostasis without blood loss in a rat liver injury model. The dry BSP/DB prepared by lyophilization inherited excellent clotting ability of BSP/DB adhesive, which could realize rapidly the cruor of anticoagulant whole blood within 1 min.

While the spherical nucleic acid (SNA) architecture has elevated liposomal stability to increase therapeutic efficacy, the chemistry used to anchor the DNA to the liposome core is an underexplored design parameter with a potentially widespread biological impact. Herein, we explore the impact of SNA anchoring chemistry on immunotherapeutic function by systematically studying the importance of hydrophobic dodecane anchoring groups in attaching DNA strands to the liposome core. By deliberately modulating the size of the oligomer that defines the anchor, a library of structures has been established. These structures, combined with in vitro and in vivo immune stimulation analyses, elucidate the relationships between and importance of anchoring strength and dissociation of DNA from the SNA shell on its biological properties. Importantly, the most stable dodecane anchor, (C12)9, is superior to the n = 4–8 and 10 structures and quadruples immune stimulation compared to conventional cholesterol-anchored SNAs. When the OVA1 peptide antigen is encapsulated by the (C12)9 SNA and used as a therapeutic vaccine in an E.G7-OVA tumor model, 50% of the mice survived the initial tumor, and all of those survived tumor rechallenge. Importantly, the strong innate immune stimulation does not cause a cytokine storm compared to linear immunostimulatory DNA. Moreover, a (C12)9 SNA that encapsulates a peptide targeting SARS-CoV-2 generates a robust T cell response; T cells raised from SNA treatment kill >40% of target cells pulsed with the same peptide and ca. 45% of target cells expressing the entire spike protein.

In particular, the quantum dots carried by ESC-HCM-B further amplified the effect of “nanoenzyme”; this mechanism reduced the ROS level in podocytes induced by high glucose, protected mitochondrial damage, and restored mitochondrial energy metabolism.

RSNA converts the excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells into oxygen, enhancing the DNA-damaging effects of radiotherapy to create more template lesions that impede RF progression in coalition with DOX. After radiation, ROS scavenging by RSNA accelerates RF progression through damaged template strands, increasing the frequency of RF collapse into double-strand breaks. Moreover, pretreatment with RSNA accumulates cancer cells in the S phase, exposing more RFs to radiation-induced RS.

Metformin has been proven in clinical and animal experiments to repair damaged structures and functions by promoting endogenous neurogenesis. However, in the early stage of acute SCI, the adverse pathophysiological microenvironment of the injury sites, such as reactive oxygen species and inflammatory factor storm, can prevent the activation of endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) and the differentiation of NSCs into neurons, decreasing the whole repair effect. To address those issues, a series of robust and multifunctional natural polyphenol-metformin nanoparticles (polyphenol-Met NPs) were fabricated with pH-responsiveness and excellent antioxidative capacities. The resulting NPs possessed several favorable advantages: First, the NPs were composed of active ingredients with different biological properties, without the need for carriers; second, the pH-responsiveness feature could allow targeted drug delivery at the injured site; more importantly, NPs enabled drugs with different performances to exhibit strong synergistic effects. The results demonstrated that the improved microenvironment by natural polyphenols boosted the differentiation of activated NSCs into neurons and oligodendrocytes, which could efficiently repair the injured nerve structures and enhance the functional recovery of the SCI rats. This work highlighted the design and fabrication of robust and multifunctional NPs for SCI treatment via efficient microenvironmental regulation and targeted NSCs activation.","2023-09-26","2024-07-04 22:24:05","2024-07-07 04:44:54","2024-07-04 22:23:41","18562-18575","","18","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/9Z8SSTW5/Yuan et al. - 2023 - Robust and Multifunctional Nanoparticles Assembled.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, there is a great need for longitudinal, noninvasive stem cell monitoring. Here we introduce a multidisciplinary approach combining nanosensor-augmented stem cell labeling with ultrasound guided photoacoustic (US/PA) imaging for the spatial tracking and functional assessment of transplanted stem cell fate. Specifically, our nanosensor incorporates a peptide sequence that is selectively cleaved by caspase-3, the primary effector enzyme in mammalian cell apoptosis; this cleavage event causes labeled cells to show enhanced optical absorption in the first near-infrared (NIR) window. Optimization of labeling protocols and spectral characterization of the nanosensor in vitro showed a 2.4-fold increase in PA signal from labeled cells during apoptosis while simultaneously permitting cell localization. We then successfully tracked the location and apoptotic status of mesenchymal stem cells in a mouse hindlimb ischemia model for 2 weeks in vivo, demonstrating a 4.8-fold increase in PA signal and spectral slope changes in the first NIR window under proapoptotic (ischemic) conditions. We conclude that our nanosensor allows longitudinal, noninvasive, and nonionizing monitoring of stem cell location and apoptosis, which is a significant improvement over current end-point monitoring methods such as biopsies and histological staining of excised tissue.","2023-09-26","2024-07-04 22:24:05","2024-07-06 00:55:55","2024-07-04 22:23:42","17931-17945","","18","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ZB9XGAWZ/Jhunjhunwala et al. - 2023 - In Vivo Photoacoustic Monitoring of Stem Cell Loca.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these approaches remain limited by low solubility, poor stability, and inefficient targeting of many common photosensitizers (PSs) and photothermal agents (PTAs). To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we engineered biocompatible and biodegradable tumor-targeted upconversion nanospheres with imaging capabilities. The multifunctional nanospheres consist of a sodium yttrium fluoride core doped with lanthanides (ytterbium, erbium, and gadolinium) and the PTA bismuth selenide (NaYF4:Yb/Er/Gd,Bi2Se3) enveloped in a mesoporous silica shell that encapsulates a PS, chlorin e6 (Ce6), within its pores. NaYF4:Yb/Er converts deeply penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light to visible light, which excites Ce6 to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), while Bi2Se3 efficiently converts absorbed NIR light to heat. Additionally, Gd enables magnetic resonance imaging of the nanospheres. The mesoporous silica shell is coated with DPPC/cholesterol/DSPE-PEG to retain the encapsulated Ce6 and prevent serum protein adsorption and macrophage recognition that hinder tumor targeting. Finally, the coat is conjugated to the acidity-triggered rational membrane (ATRAM) peptide, which promotes specific and efficient internalization into malignant cells in the mildly acidic microenvironment of tumors. The nanospheres facilitated tumor magnetic resonance and thermal and fluorescence imaging and exhibited potent NIR laser light-induced anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo via combined ROS production and localized hyperthermia, with negligible toxicity to healthy tissue, hence markedly extending survival.

Here, a biomolecule-driven two-factor authentication strategy for access control of molecular devices is developed. Importantly, the two-factor is realized by applying the specificity and nicking properties of the nicking enzyme and the programmable design of the DNA sequence, endowing it with the characteristic of a one-time password. To demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy, an access control module is designed and integrated to further construct a role-based molecular access control device. By constructing a command library composed of three commands (Ca, Cb, Ca and Cb), the authorized access of three roles in the molecular device is realized, in which the command Ca corresponds to the authorization of role A, Cb corresponds to the authorization of role B, and Ca and Cb corresponds to the authorization of role C. In this way, when users access the device, they not only need the correct factor but also need to apply for role authorization in advance to obtain secret information.

However, designing textiles that can achieve personal thermoregulation without energy consumption in severely hot and cold environments remains a huge challenge. Herein, a hierarchically nanofibrous (HNF) textile with improved thermal insulation and radiative thermal management functions is fabricated for efficient personal thermal management in severe temperatures. The textile consists of a radiative cooling layer, an intermediate thermal insulation layer, and a radiative heating layer, wherein the porous lignocellulose aerogel membrane (LCAM) as intermediate layer has low thermal conductivity (0.0366 W·m–1·K–1), ensuring less heat loss in cold weather and blocking external heat in hot weather. The introduction of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) increases the thermal emissivity (90.4%) of the radiative cooling layer in the atmospheric window and also endows it with a perfect self-cleaning performance. Solar absorptivity (80.1%) of the radiative heating layer is dramatically increased by adding only 0.05 wt% of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into polyacrylonitrile. An outdoor test demonstrates that the HNF textile can achieve a temperature drop of 7.2 °C compared with white cotton in a hot environment and can be as high as 12.2 °C warmer than black cotton in a cold environment.

Specific subpopulations of CD146+CD271+ umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) were isolated, from which engineered exosomes (RGD-CD146+CD271+ UCMSC-Exos) with targeted neovascularization function were obtained through gene transfection.

The results demonstrated that RGD-CD146+CD271+ UCMSC-Exos exhibited physical and chemical properties similar to those of regular exosomes. Notably, following intranasal administration, RGD-CD146+CD271+ UCMSC-Exos exhibited enhanced aggregation at the SCI center and demonstrated the specific targeting of neovascular endothelial cells. In the SCI model, intranasal administration of RGD-CD146+CD271+ UCMSC-Exos reduced Evans blue dye leakage, increased tight junction protein expression, and improved neurological function recovery. In vitro testing revealed that RGD-CD146+CD271+ UCMSC-Exos treatment significantly reduced the permeability of bEnd.3 cells subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation, thereby restoring the integrity of tight junctions.

In this study, an injectable hydrogel platform based on sodium alginate (SA), with multifunctions of photothermal and Ca2+-overload cell apoptosis, was explored as a siBRAF carrier for metastatic melanoma therapy. We employed polydopamine nanoparticles (PDAs) as a photothermal core and constructed a calcium phosphate (CaP) shell via biomineralization (PDA@CaP) to load siBRAF (PDA@siBRAF/CaP). The pH-sensitive CaP shell facilitated the release of Ca2+ under the weakly acidic tumor microenvironment, triggering the gelation of PDA@siBRAF/CaP-SA to localized release siBRAF at tumor sites with the interruption of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) pathway. Besides, the continuous release of Ca2+ could also lead to Ca2+-overload cell apoptosis. Moreover, the photothermal effect of PDA regulated the release kinetics, resulting in coordinated therapeutic abilities of individual components in the PDA@siBRAF/CaP-SA hydrogels. Consequently, the effective inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis was achieved in vitro and in vivo using a highly metastatic melanoma cell line B16F10 as the model, by combining photothermal ablation, Ca2+ overload, and BRAF silencing.

Gold nanoclusters are known for their in vivo safety and intrinsic biomedical activities. In this study, a glutathione-protected gold nanocluster is synthesized and evaluated, namely, GA.

Intracellular delivery was optimized in vitro and validated in vivo by using an aggressive human DLBCL xenograft model. Targeted delivery of ATSP-7041 unlocked the ability to systemically cotreat with ABT-263, resulting in delayed tumor growth, prolonged survival, and no overt toxicity. This work demonstrates a proof-of-concept for antigen-specific targeting of polymersome nanomedicines, targeted delivery of a stapled peptide in vivo, and synergistic dual intrinsic apoptotic therapy against DLBCL via direct p53 reactivation and BCL-2 family modulation.","2023-12-12","2024-07-04 22:24:05","2024-07-05 23:56:55","2024-07-04 22:23:57","23374-23390","","23","17","","ACS Nano","Targeted Polymersome Delivery of a Stapled Peptide for Drugging the Tumor Protein p53","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/TDZAXWKR/Schnorenberg et al. - 2023 - Targeted Polymersome Delivery of a Stapled Peptide.pdf","","Log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Competing microscopic processes fundamentally limit the parameter space for optimal growth of the desired material. Kinetic limitations for diffusion and nucleation cause a high density of small domains and grain boundaries. These are usually overcome by increasing the growth temperature and decreasing the growth rate. In contrast, the nature of molecular precursors with limited thermal stability can result in dissociation and preferential desorption, leading to an undesired or ill-defined composition of the 2D-material. Here we demonstrate these constraints in a combined low-energy electron diffraction and low-energy electron microscopy study by examining the selective formation of single-layer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and borophene on Ir(111) using a borazine precursor. We derive a temperature–pressure phase diagram and apply classical nucleation theory to describe our results. By considering the competing processes, we find an optimum growth temperature for hBN of 950 °C. At lower temperatures, the hBN island density is increased, while at higher temperatures the precursor disintegrates and borophene is formed.

Indeed, the subendothelial retention of lipoproteins in the artery wall triggers multiple events of inflammation in macrophages and is a major contributor to the pathological progression of atherosclerosis. It has been gradually recognized that modulating inflammation is, therefore, an attractive avenue to forestall and treat atherosclerosis and its complications. Unfortunately, challenges with specificity and efficacy in managing plaque inflammation have hindered progress in atherosclerosis treatment. Herein, we report an NP-mediated mRNA therapeutic approach to target atherosclerotic lesional macrophages, modulating inflammation in advanced atherosclerotic lesions for the treatment of atherosclerosis. We demonstrated that the targeted NPs containing IL-10 mRNA colocalized with M2-like macrophages and induced IL-10 production in atherosclerotic plaques following intravenous administration to Western diet (WD)-fed Ldlr–/– mice. Additionally, the lesions showed a significantly alleviated inflammatory response, as evidenced by reduced oxidative stress and macrophage apoptosis, resulting in decreased lipid deposition, diminished necrotic areas, and increased fiber cap thickness.

The effects of the PG group on protein binding, cell internalization, protein function protection, and endo/lysosomal escape were systematically evaluated. Compared to the unmodified PAEs (L3), guanidyl rich PAEs (L3PG) presented superior efficiency of protein binding and protein internalization, mainly via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In addition, both PAEs showed robust capabilities to deliver cytosolic proteins with different molecular weight (ranging from 30 to 464 kDa) and isoelectric points (ranging from 4.3 to 9), which were significantly improved in comparison with the commercial reagents of PULsin and Pierce Protein Transection Reagent.

As previously established, the late stages of fusion, including hemifusion diaphragm and pore expansions, are favored by membrane tension. However, a current understanding of how the energy barrier of earlier fusion stages is affected by membrane tension is lacking. Here, we apply a newly developed experimental approach combining micropipette-aspirated giant unilamellar vesicles and optically trapped membrane-coated beads, revealing that membrane tension inhibits lipid mixing. We show that lipid mixing is 6 times slower under a tension of 0.12 mN/m compared with tension-free membranes. Furthermore, using continuum elastic theory, we calculate the dependence of the hemifusion stalk formation energy on membrane tension and intermembrane distance and find the increase in the corresponding energy barrier to be 1.6 kBT in our setting, which can explain the increase in lipid mixing time delay. Finally, we show that tension can be a significant factor in the stalk energy if the pre-fusion intermembrane distance is on the order of several nanometers, while for membranes that are tightly docked, tension has a negligible effect.","2023-10-10","2024-07-04 22:24:05","2024-07-06 00:51:05","2024-07-04 22:24:03","18942-18951","","19","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/YTIHC942/Shendrik et al. - 2023 - Membrane Tension Inhibits Lipid Mixing by Increasi.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three different methods to operate transient transcription machineries and to modulate the gated transcription processes of target RNAs are introduced. One method involves the design of a reaction module consisting of transcription templates being triggered by promoter fuel strands transcribing target RNAs and in parallel generating functional DNAzymes in the transcription templates, modulating the dissipative depletion of the active templates and the transient operation of transcription circuits. The second approach involves the application of a reaction module consisting of two transcription templates being activated by a common fuel promoter strand. While one transcription template triggers the transcription of the target RNA, the second transcription template transcribes the anti-fuel strand, displacing the promoter strand associated with the transcription templates, leading to the depletion of the transcription templates and to the dynamic transient modulation of the transcription process. The third strategy involves the assembly of a reaction module consisting of a reaction template triggered by a fuel promoter strand transcribing the target RNA. The concomitant nickase-stimulated depletion of the promoter strand guides the transient modulation of the transcription process. Via integration of two parallel fuel-triggered transcription templates in the three transcription reaction modules and application of template-specific blocker units, the parallel and gated transiently modulated transcription of two different RNA aptamers is demonstrated.

Using functional screening and transcriptome analyses, glutathione synthetase (GSS) was found to be a potential regulator of radioresistance through ferroptosis. High GSS levels were closely related to poor prognosis and relapse in patients with glioma. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that GSS was associated with the suppression of radiotherapy-induced ferroptosis in glioma cells.

It has been proposed that the earliest enzymes may have arisen from the self-assembly of short peptides into supramolecular amyloid-like structures. Several artificial amyloids have been shown to display catalytic activity while offering advantages over natural enzymes in terms of modularity, flexibility, stability, and reusability. Hydrolases, especially esterases, are the most common artificial amyloid-like nanozymes with some reported to act as carbonic anhydrases (CA). Their hydrolytic activity is often dependent on the binding of metallic cofactors through a coordination triad composed of His residues in the β-strands, which mimic the arrangement found in natural metalloenzymes. Tyr residues contribute to the coordination of metal ions in the active center of metalloproteins; however, their use has been mostly neglected in the design of metal-containing amyloid-based nanozymes. We recently reported that four different polar prion-inspired heptapeptides spontaneously self-assembled into amyloid fibrils. Their sequences lack His but contain three alternate Tyr residues exposed to solvent. We combine experiments and simulations to demonstrate that the amyloid fibrils formed by these peptides can efficiently coordinate and retain different divalent metal cations, functioning as both metal scavengers and nanozymes.

While the majority of studies have focused on the biological mechanisms underlying particle internalization, less attention has been given to questions of a more quantitative nature, such as how many nanoparticles enter cells and how rapidly they do so. To address this, we exposed human embryonic kidney cells to 40–200 nm carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles and the particles were observed by live-cell confocal and super-resolution stimulated emission depletion fluorescence microscopy. How long a particle remained at the cell membrane after adsorbing onto it was monitored, distinguishing whether the particle ultimately desorbed again or was internalized by the cell. We found that the majority of particles desorb, but interestingly, most of the particles that are internalized do so within seconds, independently of particle size. As this is faster than typical endocytic mechanisms, we interpret this observation as the particles entering via an endocytic event that is already taking place (as opposed to directly triggering their own uptake) or possibly via an as yet uncharacterized endocytic route. Aside from the rapidly internalizing particles, a minority of particles remain at the membrane for tens of seconds to minutes before desorbing or being internalized. We also followed particles after cell internalization, observing particles that appeared to exit the cell, sometimes as rapidly as within tens of seconds.

To clean biocontaminated surfaces, alcohol-based disinfectants have been predominantly used for disinfecting high-touch areas in diverse settings. However, due to its limited antimicrobial activities and concern over the emergence of alcohol-tolerant strains, much effort has been made to develop highly efficient disinfectant formulations. In this study, we hypothesize that the addition of a physical pathogen inactivation mechanism by salt recrystallization (besides the existing chemical inactivation mechanism by alcohol in such formulations) can improve inactivation efficiency by preventing the emergence of alcohol tolerance. To this end, we employed the drying-induced salt recrystallization process to implement the concept of highly efficient alcohol-based disinfectant formulations. To identify the individual and combined effects of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and NaCl, time-dependent morphological/structural changes of various IPA solutions containing NaCl have been characterized by optical microscopy/X-ray diffraction analysis. Their antimicrobial activities have been tested on surfaces (glass slide, polystyrene Petri dish, and stainless steel) contaminated with Gram-positive/negative bacteria (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica Typhimurium) and viruses (A/PR8/34 H1N1 influenza virus and HCoV-OC43 human coronavirus). We found that additional salt crystallization during the drying of the alcohol solution facilitated stronger biocidal effects than IPA-only formulations, regardless of the types of solid surfaces and pathogens, including alcohol-tolerant strains adapted from wild-type Escherichia coli MG1655.

As chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell-derived exosomes contain tumor-targeted CARs and cytotoxic granules (granzyme B and perforin), they are considered potential delivery vehicles for PTX. However, the low drug-loading capacity and hepatotropic properties of exosomes are obstacles to their application to extrahepatic cancer. Here, a hybrid nanovesicle named Lip-CExo@PTX was designed for immunochemotherapy of lung cancer by fusing exosomes derived from bispecific CAR-T cells targeting both mesothelin (MSLN) and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) with lung-targeted liposomes. Due to the lung-targeting ability of the liposomes, over 95% of intravenously administered Lip-CExo@PTX accumulated in lung tissue. In addition, with the help of the anti-MSLN single-chain variable fragment (scFv), the PTX and cytotoxic granules inside Lip-CExo@PTX were further delivered into MSLN-positive tumors. Notably, the anti-PD-L1 scFv on Lip-CExo@PTX blocked PD-L1 on the tumors to avoid T cell exhaustion and promoted PTX-induced immunogenic cell death. Furthermore, Lip-CExo@PTX prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing mice in a CT-26 metastatic lung cancer model.

Although various anti-inflammatory and/or antibacterial grafts have been proposed to turn the scale, most of them suffer from the uncertainty of drug-induced adverse effects, low mechanical strength, and tissue adhesiveness. Here, inspired by the tendon anatomy and pathophysiology of adhesion development, an adhesive and robust dual-layer Janus patch is developed, whose inner layer facing the operated tendon is a multifunctional electrospun hydrogel patch (MEHP), encircled further by a poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) fibrous outer layer facing the surrounding tissue. Specifically, MEHP is prepared by gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles, which are co-electrospun first and then treated by tannic acid (TA). The inner MEHP exhibits superior mechanical performance, adhesion strength, and outstanding antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and antibacterial properties, and it can adhere to the injury site offering a favorable microenvironment for tendon regeneration. Meanwhile, the outer PLLA acts as a physical barrier that prevents extrinsic cells and tissues from invading the defect site, reducing peritendinous adhesion formation. This work presents a proof-of-concept of a drug-free graft with anisotropic adhesive and biological functions to concert the healing phases of injured tendon by alleviating incipient inflammation and oxidative damage but supporting tissue regeneration and reducing tendon adhesion in the later phase of repair and remodeling.

Since the nematodes’ pharynx shares similarities with the human heart, we assessed the general and pharyngeal effects of drugs and polypyrrole nanoparticles (Ppy NPs) using C. elegans. The evaluation of FDA-approved drugs, such as Propranolol and Racepinephrine reproduced the arrhythmic behavior reported in humans and supported the use of this small animal model. Consequently, Ppy NPs were evaluated due to their research interest in cardiac arrhythmia treatments. The NPs’ biocompatibility was confirmed by assessing survival, growth and development, reproduction, and transgenerational toxicity in C. elegans. Interestingly, the NPs increased the pharyngeal pumping rate of C. elegans in two slow-pumping mutant strains, JD21 and DA464. Moreover, the NPs increased the pumping rate over time, which sustained up to a day post-excretion. By measuring pharyngeal calcium levels, we found that the impact of Ppy NPs on the pumping rate could be mediated through calcium signaling.

Glucose oxidase (GOx), Fe2+, and pH-responsive second near-infrared (NIR-II) LET-1052 probe were coloaded by PM to obtain the final theranostics. The activity of metastable Fe2+ remained by the unsaturated coordination with PEG–PAE. Then tumor accumulation and exposure of Fe2+ were achieved by charge-reversal cationization of PEG–PAE, which was further enhanced by a GOx catalysis-triggered pH decrease. Together with the abundant H2O2 generation and pH decrease through GOx catalysis, the limiting factors of the Fenton reaction were comprehensively optimized, achieving the enhanced CDT both in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide a strategy for comprehensively optimizing intratumoral Fenton reaction factors to overcome the intrinsic drawbacks of current CDT.","2023-09-12","2024-07-04 22:56:15","2024-07-08 01:01:04","2024-07-04 22:54:57","16743-16756","","17","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/MSCZHEUM/Zhang et al. - 2023 - Comprehensively Optimizing Fenton Reaction Factors.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cationic AIE PS TPAQ-Py-PF6 (TPA = triphenylamine, Q = anthraquinone, Py = pyridine) contains three important moieties to cooperatively enhance free radical generation: the AIE-active TPA unit ensures the effective triplet exciton generation in aggregate, the anthraquinone moiety possesses the redox cycling ability to promote electron transfer, while the cationic methylpyridinium cation further increases intramolecular charge transfer and electron separation processes.

Both experimental and theoretical results confirm the effectiveness of our molecular cationization and BSA immobilization cascade strategy for enhancing OH·– generation.

As Impranil is being degraded by the enzymes, a characteristic quenching at a short reaction time followed by a brightening at a longer reaction time in the fluorescence signal is observed.

First, the Tm-doping ratio was precisely adjusted to improve the relative emission intensity at 475 nm of UCNPs (11.5-fold). Moreover, the J-aggregate of ZnTPP increased the absorption at 475 nm (163.5-fold) of monomer; both together optimize the FRET matching between UCNPs and porphyrin for effective NIR photodynamic therapy. Simultaneously, the emission at 800 nm was utilized to magnify the photothermal effect of CuS nanoparticles for photothermal therapy via the second FRET route.

A molecular weight of 1 kDa for PEG was optimal for the dissociation. The most important feature of this dissociation method is that it can operate in complex biofluids such as plasma, saliva, bile, urine, cell media, or even seawater without a significant decrease in performance. Moreover, the peptide–particle assemblies are highly stable and do not degrade (or express of loss of signal upon dissociation) when dried and resolubilized, frozen and thawed, or left in daylight for a month.

These data suggest that mannosylated lipid nanoparticles may have the therapeutic potential to mitigate lung injury during mechanical ventilation.","2023-09-12","2024-07-04 22:56:15","2024-07-07 05:20:06","2024-07-04 22:55:10","16539-16552","","17","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/PX42CTPR/Fei et al. - 2023 - Macrophage-Targeted Lipid Nanoparticle Delivery of.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, a carbon dots (CDs)-based bifunctional nanosystem (MnZ@Au), acting as photosensitizer and nanozyme with cascading glucose oxidase (GOx)- and catalase (CAT)-like reactivity, was developed for improving hypoxia and regulating glucose metabolism to enhance PDT. The MnZ@Au was constructed using Mn-doped CDs (Mn-CDs) as a core and zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) as a shell to form a hybrid (MnZ), followed by anchoring ultrasmall Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) onto the surface of MnZ through the ion exchange and in situ reduction methods. MnZ@Au catalyzed glucose consumption and oxygen generation by cascading GOx- and CAT-like nanozyme reactions, which was further enhanced by its own photothermal properties. In vitro and in vivo studies also confirmed that MnZ@Au greatly improved CDs penetration, promoted ROS accumulation, and enhanced PDT efficacy, leading to efficient tumor growth inhibition in the breast tumor model. Besides, MnZ@Au enabled photoacoustic (PA) imaging to provide a mapping of Mn-CDs distribution and oxygen saturation, showing the real-time catalytic process of MnZ@Au in vivo. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) imaging also validated the decreased glucose uptake in tumors treated by MnZ@Au.

To delineate the site(s) of HIV-1 fusion, we implemented a triple labeling approach that involves tagging pseudoviruses with the fluid-phase viral content marker, iCherry, the viral membrane marker, DiD, and the extraviral pH sensor, ecliptic pHluorin. The viral content marker iCherry is released into the cytoplasm upon virus–cell fusion irrespective of the sites of fusion. In contrast, the extent of dilution of the membrane marker upon fusion with the PM (loss of signal) vs the endosomal membrane (no change in punctate DiD appearance) discriminates between the principal sites of viral fusion. Additionally, ecliptic pHluorin incorporated into the viral membrane reports whether virus fusion occurs in acidic endosomes. Real-time single virus imaging in living HeLa-derived cells, a CD4+ T-cell line, and activated primary human CD4+ T-cells revealed a strong (80–90%) HIV-1 preference for fusion with endosomes. Intriguingly, we observed HIV-1 fusion only with pH-neutral intracellular vesicles and never with acidified endosomes. These endocytic fusion events are likely culminating in productive infection since endocytic inhibitors, such as EIPA, Pitstop2, and Dynasore, as well as a dominant-negative dynamin-2 mutant, inhibited HIV-1 infection in HeLa-derived and primary CD4+ T-cells. Furthermore, the inhibition of endocytosis in HeLa-derived cells promoted hemifusion at the PM but abrogated complete fusion.

The QK peptide is further chemically grafted onto amyloid fibrils, and its sustainable release from the hydrogel matrix stimulates the tube formation and migration with human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Meanwhile, the nanoengineered hydrogel matrix promotes osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells due to the sustainable release of Si4+ and Mg2+ derived from clay nanosheets.

Edaravone is clinically used as an antioxidant but shows poor liver distribution. Herein, we report on the design of a Kupffer cell-oriented nanoantioxidant based on a disulfide cross-linked albumin nanoparticle containing encapsulated edaravone (EeNA) as a therapeutic for the treatment of hepatitis. Since the edaravone is bound to albumin, this results in a soluble and stable form of edaravone in water. Exchanging the intramolecular disulfide bonds to intermolecular disulfide bridges of albumin molecules allowed the preparation of a redox responsive albumin nanoparticle that is stable in the blood circulation but can release drugs into cells. Consequently, EeNA was fabricated by the nanoscale self-assembly of edaravone and albumin nanoparticles without the additives that are contained in commercially available edaravone preparations. EeNA retained its nanostructure under serum conditions, but the encapsulated edaravone was released efficiently under intracellular reducing conditions in macrophages. The EeNA was largely distributed in the liver and subsequently internalized into Kupffer cells within 60 min after injection in a concanavalin-A-induced hepatitis mouse. The survival rate of the hepatitis mice was significantly improved by EeNA due to the suppression of liver necrosis and oxidative stress by scavenging excessive ROS. Moreover, even through the postadministration, EeNA showed an excellent hepatoprotective action as well. In conclusion, EeNA has the potential for use as a nanotherapeutic against various types of hepatitis because of its Kupffer cell targeting ability and redox characteristics.","2023-09-12","2024-07-04 22:56:15","2024-07-07 20:46:55","2024-07-04 22:55:24","16668-16681","","17","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/WGWYZUG2/Yasuda et al. - 2023 - Encapsulation of an Antioxidant in Redox-Sensitive.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, glutathione-functionalized gold nanocages loaded with the immunosuppressant fingolimod hydrochloride are developed as brain-targeted and microglia-located immunometabolic reprogramming nanomodulators (GAF NPs) for AD management. By virtue of glutathione-mediated transport properties, this nanomodulator can cross the blood-brain barrier and localize to microglia in AD lesions.

Correlation analysis based on real-time bioenergetic assessment and 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET reveals that brain glucose utilization and metabolism restored by GAF NP treatment can serve as a sensitive and effective indicator for microglial M1 to M2 polarization switching, ultimately alleviating neuroinflammation and its derived neurodegeneration as well as ameliorating cognitive decline in AD mice.

Such supporting therapies exhibit limited efficacy in vivo, in part due to the reversal of their effect within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and off-target toxicity. Here, we report a material-based approach to address this challenge. Specifically, we describe the use of polymeric micropatches as a platform for sustained, targeted activation of NK cells, an approach referred to as microparticles as cell engagers (MACE). Poly(lactide-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) micropatches, 4–8 μm in diameter and surface-modified with NK cell receptor targeting antibodies, exhibited strong adhesion to NK cells and induced their activation without the need of coadministered cytokines. The activation induced by MACE was greater than that induced by nanoparticles, attesting to the crucial role of MACE geometry in the activation of NK cells. MACE-bound NK cells remained viable and exhibited trans-endothelial migration and antitumor activity in vitro. MACE-bound NK cells activated T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells in vitro. Adoptive transfer of NK-MACE also demonstrated superior antitumor efficacy in a mouse melanoma lung metastasis model compared to unmodified NK cells.

In this study, we used bacteria (Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis) and a fungus (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as model organisms to investigate the cellular and metabolic effects of exposure to different concentrations of citrate-capped spherical AuNPs with diameters of 5 and 10 nm. In different growth media, the synthesized AuNPs displayed stability and microorganisms exhibited uniform levels of uptake. Exposure to a high concentration of AuNPs (1012 particles) resulted in a reduced cell division time and a 2-fold increase in cell density in both bacteria and fungus. The exposed cells exhibited a decrease in average cell size and an increase in the expression of FtsZ protein (cell division marker), further supporting an accelerated growth rate. Notably, exposure to such a high concentration of AuNPs did not induce DNA damage, envelope stress, or a general stress response in bacteria. Differential whole proteome analysis revealed modulation of ribosomal protein expression upon exposure to AuNPs in both E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Interestingly, the accelerated growth observed upon exposure to AuNPs was sensitive to sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) concentration of drugs that specifically target ribosome assembly and recycling. Based upon these findings, we hypothesize that exposure to high concentrations of AuNPs induces stress on the translation machinery.

However, the recently merged plasmid-borne gene mobilized colistin resistance (mcr) leads to modification of the colistin target (i.e., bacterial membrane), greatly compromising the therapy outcome of colistin. To address this unmet clinical need, a nanocomplex (CMS-pEt_20 NP) of anionic prodrug colistin methanesulfonate (CMS) and guanidinium-functionalized cationic polymer pEt_20 is developed through facile self-assembly for co-delivering an antibiotic and antimicrobial polymer with membrane affinity to reverse colistin resistance. The CMS-pEt_20 NP formation enables reversal of colistin resistance and complete killing of clinically isolated mcr-positive colistin-resistant bacteria including MDR E. coli and K. pneumoniae, while monotreatment of polymer or antibiotic at equivalent doses exhibits no antibacterial activity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CMS-pEt_20 NP enhanced the affinity of delivered CMS to the modified membrane of colistin-resistant bacteria, reviving the membrane lytic property of colistin. The increased membrane permeability caused by colistin in turn promotes an influx of pEt_20 to generate intracellular ROS stress, resulting in elimination of colistin-resistant bacteria. More importantly, a colistin-resistant mouse peritonitis-sepsis infection model demonstrates the excellent therapeutic efficacy of CMS-pEt_20 NP with 100% survival of the infected mouse. In addition, the nanocomplex is proven not toxic both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, the self-assembled antibiotic–polymer nanocomplex with two complementary antibacterial mechanisms successfully reverses the colistin resistance phenotype in bacteria, and it can be a potential strategy to treat untreatable colistin-resistant MDR bacterial infections.","2023-08-22","2024-07-04 22:56:15","2024-07-08 00:57:18","2024-07-04 22:55:44","15411-15423","","16","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/YLNDP79X/Zhao et al. - 2023 - Antibiotic–Polymer Self-Assembled Nanocomplex to R.pdf","","Log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, because molecular probes with both high labeling efficiency and tracer stability are lacking, monitoring the actions of EC-EVs in the brain remains difficult. The specific intracellular targets in the brain that EC-EVs act on to produce their protective effects are still unknown, greatly impeding their use in clinical settings. For this research, we created a probe that possessed aggregation-induced emission (AIE) traits (namely, TTCP), enabling the effective labeling of EC-EVs while preserving their physiological properties. In vitro, TTCP simultaneously had a higher EC-EV labeling efficiency and better tracer stability than the commercial EV tags PKH-67 and DiI. In vivo, TTCP precisely tracked the actions of EC-EVs in a mouse IS model without influencing their protective effects. Furthermore, through the utilization of TTCP, it was determined that astrocytes were the specific cells affected by EC-EVs and that EC-EVs exhibited a safeguarding impact on astrocytes following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. These protective effects encompassed the reduction of the inflammatory reaction and apoptosis as well as the enhancement of cell proliferation. Further analysis showed that miRNA-155-5p carried by EC-EVs is responsible for these protective effects via regulation of the c-Fos/AP-1 pathway; this information provided a strategy for IS therapy. In conclusion, TTCP has a high EC-EV labeling efficiency and favorable in vivo tracer stability during IS therapy. Moreover, EC-EVs are absorbed by astrocytes during cerebral I/R injury and promote the restoration of neurological function through the regulation of the c-Fos/AP-1 signaling pathway.","2023-08-22","2024-07-04 22:56:15","2024-07-06 06:36:06","2024-07-04 22:55:47","16174-16191","","16","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/HFUVHXMP/Gao et al. - 2023 - Observing Extracellular Vesicles Originating from .pdf","","Zero; Others","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We herein prepared a pH-responsive nanomodulator by coloading curcumin (CU, a Ca2+ enhancer) with CaCO3 and MnO2 into nanoparticles coated with a cancer cell membrane. This nanoplatform was aimed at reprogramming the tumor microenvironment (TME) and providing an antitumor treatment through ion fluctuation. The obtained nanoplatform, called CM NPs, could neutralize protons by decomposing CaCO3 and attenuating cellular acidity, they could generate Ca2+ and release CU, elevating Ca2+ levels and promoting ROS generation in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, thus, inducing immunogenic cell death. Mn2+ could decompose the endogenous H2O2 into O2 to relieve hypoxia and enhance the sensitivity of cGAS, activating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. In addition, this strategy allowed the reprogramming of the immune TME, inducing macrophage polarization and dendritic cell maturation via antigen cross-presentation, thereby increasing the immune system’s ability to combat the tumor effectively. Moreover, the as-prepared nanoparticles enhanced the antitumor responses of the αPD1 treatment.

The FBC was facilely synthesized via magnetic-assisted interface coassembly, possessing a higher electrical output by inducing larger local strain from the anisotropic structure and strain coherence. Subsequently, wireless magnetoelectric neuromodulation in vitro was synergistically achieved by voltage-gated ion channels and to a lesser extent, the mechanosensitive ion channels. Furthermore, FBC less-invasively injected into the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) obviously inhibited acute and continuous seizures under magnetic loading, exhibiting excellent therapeutic effects in suppressing both high voltage electroencephalogram signals propagation and behavioral seizure stage and neuroprotection of the hippocampus mediated via the Papez circuit similar to conventional wired-in DBS.

Nevertheless, the potential of two-dimensional polygonal nanoplates to self-assemble into extended three-dimensional structures with compartments and corridors has remained unexplored. In this paper, we show coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations demonstrating self-assembly of hexagonal/triangular nanoplates via complementary interactions into faceted, sponge-like “bicontinuous polyhedra” (or infinite polyhedra) whose flat walls partition space into a pair of mutually interpenetrating labyrinths. Two bicontinuous polyhedra can be self-assembled: the regular (or Platonic) Petrie–Coxeter infinite polyhedron (denoted {6,4|4}) and the semi-regular Hart “gyrangle”. The latter structure is chiral, with both left- and right-handed versions. We show that the Petrie–Coxeter assembly is constructed from two complementary populations of hexagonal nanoplates. Furthermore, we find that the 3D chiral Hart gyrangle can be assembled from identical achiral triangular nanoplates decorated with regioselective complementary interaction sites. The assembled Petrie–Coxeter and Hart polyhedra are faceted versions of two of the simplest triply periodic minimal surfaces, namely, Schwarz’s primitive and Schoen’s gyroid surfaces, respectively, offering alternative routes to those bicontinuous nanostructures, which are widespread in synthetic and biological materials.","2023-08-22","2024-07-04 22:56:15","2024-07-07 18:49:56","2024-07-04 22:55:55","15371-15378","","16","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/9HR66ILH/Tanaka et al. - 2023 - Programmable Self-Assembly of Nanoplates into Bico.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, downregulation of platelet-derived TGFβ is expected to inhibit the metastasis of circulating tumor cells. Here, unfolded human serum albumin (HSA)-coated perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA) nanoparticles were constructed to display a favorable platelet delivery and an antiplatelet effect to downregulate platelet-derived TGFβ in vitro and in blood plasma. PFTBA@HSA-mediated TGFβ downregulation impaired epithelial-mesenchymal transition of tumor cells as well as their migration and invasion behaviors and enhanced immune surveillance of NK cells. Intravenous injection of PFTBA@HSA effectively reduced tumor metastasis on the lungs or liver to improve the survival rate of mice on multiple metastatic models, including CT26 colon cancer, B16F10 melanoma, and 4T1 breast cancer. Compared with the clinical antiplatelet drug ticagrelor, PFTBA@HSA reduced bleeding risk when displaying a favorable downregulation on platelet-derived TGFβ, thereby obtaining a higher therapy benefit.

Here a dual-target cooperatively responsive fluorescent nanomachine by the innovative application of two targets─responsive strand migration system with a single-amplification-cycle element was developed for the simultaneous detection of GC biomarkers miR-5585-5p and PLS3 mRNA, which were selected by next-generation sequencing and RT-qPCR.

Mechanoluminescent (ML) nanodots of SrAl2O4:Eu2+ (SAOE) and PL nanodots of ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ (ZGC) were deposited on mesoporous silicates to obtain mSZ nanoparticles (NPs), followed by partially coating with polydopamine (PDA) caps and loading NO donors to prepare Janus mSZ@PDA-NO NPs. The ML emission bands of SAOE nanodots overlap with the excitation band of ZGC, and the persistent near-infrared (NIR) emission could be repeatedly activated by ultrasonication. The PL emission acts as an internal NIR source to produce a thermophoretic force and NO gas propellers to drive the motion of Janus NPs. Compared with the commonly used intermittent NIR illumination at both 660 and 808 nm, the persistent motion of ultrasound-activated NPs enhances cellular uptake and long-lasting PTT and intracellular NO levels to combat tumor cells without the use of any chemotherapeutic drugs. The ultrasound-activated persistent motion promotes intratumoral accumulation and tumor distribution of PTT/NO therapeutics and exhibits significantly higher tumor growth inhibition, longer animal survival, and larger intratumoral NO levels than those who experience external NIR illumination.

The mechanically robust LP-based membrane can perform simultaneously as a separator and a quasi-solid-state electrolyte to inhibit dendrite growth and water-induced side reactions at the Zn/electrolyte interface. A combination of density functional theory calculations, theoretical analyses, and experiments ascertains that the water activities associated with self-dissociation, byproduct formation, and electrochemical decomposition could be substantially suppressed when the water molecules are absorbed by LP. This could be attributed to the high water adsorption and hydration capabilities of LP nanocrystals, resulting from the strong Coulombic and hydrogen-binding interactions between water and LP.

Repolarization of TAMs to the M1-like phenotype could secrete proinflammatory cytokines and reverse the immunosuppressive state of the TME. However, we found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by repolarized TAMs could be a double-edged sword: ROS cause a stronger suppressive effect on CD8 T cells through an increased proportion of apoptotic regulatory T (Treg) cells. Thus, simply repolarizing TAMs while ignoring the suppressed function of T cells is insufficient for generating adequate antitumor immunity. Accordingly, we engineered multifunctional redox-responsive nanoplatform NPs (M+C+siPD-L1) with Toll-like receptor agonist (M), catalase (C), and siPD-L1 encased for coregulation of both TAMs and T cells to maximize cancer immunotherapy. Our results demonstrated that NPs (M+C+siPD-L1) showed superior biocompatibility and intratumor accumulation. For in vitro experiments, NPs (M+C+siPD-L1) simultaneously repolarized TAMs to the M1-like phenotype, hydrolyzed extra ROS, knocked down the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells, and rescued the function of CD8 T cells suppressed by Treg cells.

However, faradaic charge injection at the interface of the electrode and nerve tissue causes irreversible gas evolution, oxidation of electrodes, and reduction of biological ions, thus causing undesired tissue damage and electrode degradation. Here we report a conformable neural interface engineering based on multicross-linked membrane–ionogel assembly (termed McMiA), which enables nonfaradaic neurostimulation without irreversible charge transfer reaction. The McMiA consists of a genipin-cross-linked biopolymeric ionogel coupled with a dopamine-cross-linked graphene oxide membrane to prevent ion exchange between biological and synthetic McMiA ions and to function as a bioadhesive forming covalent bonds with the target tissues. In addition, the demonstration of bioelectronic medicine via the McMiA-based neurostimulation of sciatic nerves shows the enhanced clinical utility in treating the overactive bladder syndrome. As the McMiA-based neural interface is soft, robust for bioadhesion, and stable in a physiological environment, it can offer significant advancement in biocompatibility and long-term operability for neural interface engineering.","2023-08-08","2024-07-04 22:56:15","2024-07-07 22:33:23","2024-07-04 22:56:05","14706-14717","","15","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/S94K68VJ/Kim et al. - 2023 - Implantable Multi-Cross-Linked Membrane-Ionogel As.pdf","","Others","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BNF can be severely compromised by abiotic stresses. Enhancing BNF is increasingly important not only to alleviate global food insecurity but also to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture by decreasing chemical fertilizer inputs. However, this has proven challenging using current genetic modification or bacterial nodulation methods. Here, we demonstrate that a single application of a low dose (10 mg/kg) of molybdenum disulfide nanoparticles (MoS2 NPs) can enhance soybean BNF and grain yield by 30%, compared with conventional molybdate fertilizer. Unlike molybdate, MoS2 NPs can more sustainably release Mo, which then is effectively incorporated as a cofactor for the synthesis of nitrogenase and molybdenum-based enzymes that subsequently enhance BNF. Sulfur is also released sustainably and incorporated into biomolecule synthesis, particularly in thiol-containing antioxidants. The superior antioxidant enzyme activity of MoS2 NPs, together with the thiol compounds, protect the nodules from reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage, delay nodule aging, and maintain the BNF function for a longer term. The multifunctional nature of MoS2 NPs makes them a highly effective strategy to enhance plant tolerance to abiotic stresses. Given that the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials can be readily modulated, material performance (e.g., ROS capturing capacity) can be further enhanced by several synthesis strategies. This study thus demonstrates that nanotechnology can be an efficient and sustainable approach to enhancing BNF and crop yield under abiotic stress and combating global food insecurity.","2023-08-08","2024-07-04 22:56:15","2024-07-06 06:36:28","2024-07-04 22:56:06","14761-14774","","15","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/HPRD6DEL/Li et al. - 2023 - Molybdenum Nanofertilizer Boosts Biological Nitrog.pdf","","Others","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address these challenges, this study presents a subzero-temperature-enabled molecule stacking strategy for the on-demand tailoring of aptamer glues for the precision recognition and efficient degradation of membrane protein. Mechanistic studies revealed that nucleic acid molecule stacking occurred during the freezing and melting processes, facilitating a rapid click reaction by bringing two reactive groups together. In vitro investigations demonstrated that the strategy confers aptamer glues with significantly enhanced specific recognition ability and binding affinity, allowing the distinction of a targeted cell line from a nontargeted cell line. Moreover, the engineered aptamer glue exhibited impressive targeted cell membrane protein degradation ability; around 74% of the c-Met protein was degraded in 24 h.

Unfortunately, there are currently no approved drugs capable of effectively treating NASH due to the challenges in addressing fibrosis and restoring extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis. We discovered a significant up-regulation of interleukin-11 (IL-11) in fibrotic livers using two well-established murine models of NASH. To leverage this signaling pathway, we developed a nanoparticle (NP)-assisted RNA interfering approach that specifically targets activated HSCs (aHSCs), blocking IL-11/ERK signaling to regulate HSC transdifferentiation along with fibrotic remodeling. The most potent NP, designated NP-AEAA, showed enhanced accumulation in fibrotic livers with NASH and was primarily enriched in aHSCs. We further investigated the therapeutic efficacy of aHSC-targeting NP-AEAA encapsulating small interfering RNA (siRNA) against IL11 or its cognate receptor IL11ra1 (termed siIL11@NP-AEAA or siIL11ra1@NP-AEAA, respectively) for resolving fibrosis and NASH. Our results demonstrate that both siIL11@NP-AEAA and siIL11ra1@NP-AEAA effectively inhibit HSC activation and resolve fibrosis and inflammation in two well-established murine models of NASH. Notably, siIL11ra1@NP-AEAA exhibits a superior therapeutic effect over siIL11@NP-AEAA, in terms of reducing liver steatosis and fibrosis as well as recovering liver function. These results constitute a targeted nanoparticulate siRNA therapeutic approach against the IL-11 signaling pathway of aHSCs in the fibrotic liver, offering a promising therapeutic intervention for NASH and other diseases.","2023-08-08","2024-07-04 22:56:15","2024-07-08 00:02:52","2024-07-04 22:56:12","14852-14870","","15","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/TPAPRFQV/Zhang et al. - 2023 - Nanoparticle-Mediated RNA Therapy Attenuates Nonal.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, a Janus silica nanoparticle (JSNP)-based immunomodulator is explored to reshape the TME for boosting the therapeutic outcomes of αPD-L1 therapy. The designed JSNP has two distinct domains, namely, an ultra pH-responsive side (UPS), which could encapsulate PI3Kγ inhibitor IPI549 in the pore structure, and a polycation-grafted intra-glutathione (GSH)-sensitive side (IGS), which could absorb CXCL9 cDNA on the surface. The final IPI549@UPS-IGS-PDMAEMA@CXCL9 cDNA (IUIPC) could release IPI549 in weak acid TME to target myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to reverse negative immunoregulation and then release CXCL9 cDNA in tumor cells with abundant GSH for sustained CXCL9 chemokine expression and secretion to improve cytotoxic lymphocyte recruitment signals, thereby jointly restoring tumor sensitivity to PD-1/PD-L1 ICB therapy.

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol in green tea, exerts beneficial effects on the liver by modulating the gut microbiota. However, the role of microbiota in MPs-induced hepatic injuries and the protective effect of EGCG have not been clarified. Here, 5 μm MPs were orally administered to mice to induce hepatic injuries. Subsequently, antibiotic cocktail (ABX) and fecal microbial transplant (FMT) experiments were performed to investigate the underlying microbial mechanisms. Additionally, EGCG was orally administered to mice to explore its protection against MPs-induced hepatic injuries. Our results showed that MPs activated systemic and hepatic inflammation, promoted fibrosis, and altered the liver metabolome; meanwhile, MPs damaged the gut homeostasis by disturbing the gut microbiome, promoting colonic inflammation, and impairing the intestinal barrier. Notably, MPs reduced the abundance of the probiotics Akkermansia, Mucispirillum, and Faecalibaculum while increasing the pathogenic Tuzzerella. Interestingly, the elimination of gut microbiota mitigated MPs-induced colonic inflammation and intestinal barrier impairment. Moreover, ABX ameliorated MPs-induced systemic and hepatic inflammation but not fibrosis. Correspondingly, microbiota from MPs-administered mice induced colonic, systemic, and hepatic inflammation, while their profibrosis effect on the liver was not observed. Finally, EGCG elevated the abundance of probiotics and effectively repressed MPs-induced colonic inflammation. MPs-induced systemic and hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and remodeling of the liver metabolome were also attenuated by EGCG. These findings illustrated that gut microbiota contributed to MPs-induced colonic and hepatic injuries, while EGCG could serve as a potential prevention strategy for these adverse consequences.","2023-08-08","2024-07-04 22:58:46","2024-07-07 19:25:55","2024-07-04 22:57:09","15125-15145","","15","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/P26DYTDV/Zhang et al. - 2023 - Gut Microbiota Participates in Polystyrene Micropl.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To overcome these limitations, an oxidation-resistant silicon nanosystem for intelligent controlled ferrous foliar delivery to crops was first developed by using environmentally friendly micro/nano structured hollow silicon as carrier, and combining with vitamin C (in situ antioxidant) to synthesize an oxidation-resistant ferrous foliar fertilizer (ORFFF) for ameliorating Fe-deficiency in crops and increasing crop yield. Compared with TFFF, the ORFFF has excellent ferrous AC (only 11.5% of Fe(II) was oxidized in ORFFF within 72 h), ultrahigh FAE (∼84% of adhesion percentage (%) after two-times simulated rain rinsing), nutrient slow-release ability (720 h gradually release 100.6 mg·g–1), pH-controlled release ability (pH 3–8), and verified high biological safety (100% survival rate for zebrafish and earthworm). The pot experiments showed that ORFFF can correct the Fe-deficiency symptoms of tomato seedlings promptly compared with TFFF, and the FUE of ORFFF is 4.2 times that of TFFF. The specific pH responsiveness of ORFFF can control the slow-release rate of Fe(II) to satisfy the needs of Fe in varying crops and different growing periods of crops.

Most biological data available are based on in vitro two-dimensional (2D) cellular models, which fail to recapitulate the three-dimensional (3D) in vivo systems. This can be attributed to the lack of cell–matrix interaction and the limitless access to nutrients and oxygen, in contrast to in vivo systems. Despite the emergence of a plethora of 3D matrices to address this challenge, there are few reports offering a proper characterization of these matrices or studying how the cell–matrix interaction influences cellular metabolism in correlation with gene expression. In this study, two tetrameric ultrashort self-assembling peptide sequences, FFIK and FIIK, were used to create in vitro 3D models using well-described human dermal fibroblast cells. The peptide sequences are derived from naturally occurring amino acids that are capable of self-assembling into stable hydrogels without UV or chemical cross-linking. Our results showed that 2D cultured fibroblasts exhibited distinct metabolic and transcriptomic profiles compared to 3D cultured cells. The observed changes in the metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles were closely interconnected and influenced several important metabolic pathways including the TCA cycle, glycolysis, MAPK signaling cascades, and hemostasis.

The Fe-TA@mGN “shield” not only acted as a dynamic barrier to enhance the gastrointestinal stress resistance ability of EcN but also aided the intestinal colonization of EcN as well as synergized with EcN for the alleviation of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced colitis. More specifically, with the protection of the Fe-TA@mGN “shield”, the survival rate of armed EcN could be up to ∼1720 times higher than that of bare EcN after exposure to simulated gastric fluid. Excitingly, the intestinal retention rate of EcN@Fe-TA@mGN was as high as 47.54 ± 6.06% at 16 h post-administration, while almost all bare EcNs were excreted out at 8 h post-administration. With all of the aforementioned attributes, EcN@Fe-TA@mGN efficiently alleviated colitis, verified by the repair of the intestinal barrier and the attenuation of inflammation. Moreover, for EcN@Fe-TA@mGN, mGN synergized with EcN to positively modulate gut microbiota and promote the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs, especially for butyric acid, a primary source for maintaining intestinal health), both of which would further advance the alleviation of colitis.

To identify the potential therapeutic effects of enhanced intracellular uptake, magnetic hyperthermia as antitumor therapy was investigated under varying conditions of magnetic hyperthermia and RMFs.

In this work, we discovered important factors of cells and phages that greatly influence the phage transduction. The up-regulation of PrimPol or the down-regulation of DMBT1 in cells significantly enhanced the phage transduction efficiency. Furthermore, we found that the phage transduction efficiency was inversely correlated with the phage size. By carefully reconstructing the phage origin with the gene of interest, we designed “TransPhage” with a minimal length and maximal transduction efficiency. We showed that TransPhage successfully transduced the human cells with an excellent efficiency (up to 95%) comparable to or superior to that of the adeno-associated virus vectors. Moreover, we showed that TransPhage’s tropism was specific to the cells that overexpress the target antigen, whereas adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) promiscuously infected many cell types.

We tested the effect of CuO NP aerosols on immune responses in healthy, house dust mite (HDM) asthmatic, or allergen immunotherapy (AIT)-treated asthmatic mice (BALB/c, females). The AIT consisted of a vaccine comprising HDM allergens and CpG-loaded nanoparticles (CpG NPs). AIT treatment involved mice being immunized (via subcutaneous (sc) injection; 2 doses) while concomitantly being exposed to CuO NP aerosols (over a 2 week period), starting on the day of the first vaccination. Mice were then sensitized twice by sc injection and subsequently challenged with HDM extract 10 times by intranasal instillation. The asthmatic model followed the same timeline except that no immunizations were administered. All mice were necropsied 24 h after the end of the HDM challenge. CuO NP-exposed healthy mice showed a significant decrease in TH1 and TH2 cells, and an elevation in T-bet+ Treg cells, even 40 days after the last exposure to CuO NPs.

Herein, we have constructed the functional nucleic acids (FNAs)-engineered nanoplatforms based on the concept of a bio-barcode (BBC) for synergistic targeted therapy of multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer. In this study, the platinum(IV) prodrug is synthesized to covalently link two kinds of FNAs at a rational ratio to fabricate three-dimensional BBC-like DNA nanoscaffolds, accompanied by the one-pot encapsulation of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) through electrostatic interaction. The multivalent AS1411 aptamers equipped in ZnO@BBCs facilitate specific and efficient endocytosis into MDR human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549/DDP). In response to the intracellular environment of A549/DDP cells, such as the lysosome-acidic pH and overexpressed GSH, the ZnO NPs are degraded into Zn2+ ions for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), while the Pt(IV) prodrugs are reduced into Pt(II) active species by glutathione (GSH), followed by the release of therapeutic DNAzymes for chemotherapy and gene therapy. In particular, the designed system plays an important role in remodeling the intracellular environment to reverse cancer MDR. On the one hand, the depletion of GSH promotes the downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) for amplifying oxidative stress and increasing lipid peroxidation (LPO), resulting in the activation of ferroptosis. On the other hand, the silence of early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1) mRNA by Zn2+-dependent DNAzymes directly inhibits the proliferation and migration of MDR cells, which further suppresses the P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated drug efflux. Thus, the proposed nanoplatforms show great promise for the development of versatile therapeutic tools and personalized nanomedicines for MDR cancers.","2023-07-25","2024-07-04 22:58:46","2024-07-07 21:59:43","2024-07-04 22:57:21","13533-13544","","14","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/RF5D554Y/Zhi et al. - 2023 - Functional Nucleic Acids-Engineered Bio-Barcode Na.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Initially, a single Ψ-junction microfluidic chip is used to generate a steady-state salt concentration gradient in the direction perpendicular to the flow. As a result, fluorescent nanobeads dispersed in the electrolyte solutions accumulate into symmetric regions of the channel, appearing as two distinct symmetric stripes when the channel is observed from the top via epi-fluorescence microscopy. Depending on the electrolyte flow configuration and, thus, the direction of the salt concentration gradient field, the fluorescent stripes get closer to or apart from each other as the distance from the inlet increases. Our numerical and experimental analysis shows that although nanoparticle diffusiophoresis and hydrodynamic effects are involved in the accumulation process, diffusio-osmosis along the top and bottom channel walls plays a crucial role in the observed particles dynamics. In addition, we developed a proof-of-concept double Ψ-junction microfluidic device that exploits this accumulation mechanism for the size-based separation and size detection of nanobeads as well as for the measurement of zeta potential and charged lipid composition of liposomes under continuous flow settings.

However, we discovered that persistent oxidative stress during ferroptosis can upregulate the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) protein that induces therapeutic resistance (“ferroptosis resistance”), resulting in an unsatisfactory treatment outcome. To address APE1-induced therapeutic resistance, we developed a GSH/APE1 cascade activated therapeutic nanoplatform (GAN). Specifically, the GAN is self-assembled by DNA-functionalized ultrasmall iron oxide nanoparticles and further loaded with drug molecules (drug-GAN). GSH-triggered GAN disassembly can “turn on” the catalysis of GAN to induce efficient lipid peroxidation (LPO) for ferroptosis toward the tumor, which could upregulate APE1 expression. Subsequently, upregulated APE1 can further trigger accurate drug release for overcoming ferroptosis resistance and inducing the recovery of near-infrared fluorescence for imaging the dynamics of APE1. Importantly, adaptive drug release can overcome the adverse effects of APE1 upregulation by boosting intracellular ROS yield and increasing DNA damage, to offset APE1’s functions of antioxidant and DNA repair, thus leading to adaptive ferroptosis. Moreover, with overexpressed GSH and upregulated APE1 in the tumor as stimuli, the therapeutic specificity of ferroptosis toward the tumor is greatly improved, which minimized nonspecific activation of catalysis and excessive drug release in normal tissues. Furthermore, a switchable MRI contrast from negative to positive is in sync with ferroptosis activation, which is beneficial for monitoring the ferroptosis process. Therefore, this adapted imaging and therapeutic nanoplatform can not only deliver GSH/APE1-activated lipid peroxide mediated adaptive synergistic therapy but also provided a switchable MRI/dual-channel fluorescence signal for monitoring ferroptosis activation, drug release, and therapy resistance dynamics in vivo, leading to high-specificity and high-efficiency adaptive ferroptosis therapy.","2023-07-25","2024-07-04 22:58:46","2024-07-08 00:58:46","2024-07-04 22:57:26","13792-13810","","14","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ZI5H4IY3/Yue et al. - 2023 - GSHAPE1 Cascade-Activated Nanoplatform for Imagin.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We showed that PC@PLGA specifically targeted activated neutrophils and misled macrophages to recognize them as “aged” neutrophils and then initiated premature PrCR and prevented proinflammatory response and tissue damage in a mouse model of acute lung injury and severe acute pancreatitis.

Moreover, the targeting and treatment of hypoxic cancer cells and CSCs to reduce the influence of tumor hypoxia on cancer therapy remains an imperative clinical problem that needs to be addressed. Since cancer cells upregulate the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) through the Warburg effect, we considered the possibility of GLUT1-mediated transcytosis in cancer cells and developed a tumor hypoxia-targeting nanomedicine. Our experimental results indicate that glucosamine-labeled liposomal ceramide can be efficiently transported between cancer cells by GLUT1 transporters and substantially accumulated in the hypoxic area in in vitro CSC spheroids and in vivo tumor xenografts. We also verified the effects of exogenous ceramide on tumor hypoxia, including important bioactivities such as upregulation of p53 and retinoblastoma protein (RB), downregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) expression, disruption of the OCT4-SOX2 network of stemness, and inhibition of CD47 and PD-L1 expression. To achieve an ideal therapeutic outcome, we combined treatment of glucosamine-labeled liposomal ceramide with paclitaxel and carboplatin, and we found an excellent synergistic effect, with tumor clearance being noted in three-fourths of the mice.

The human trace element selenium (Se) plays essential roles in redox regulation through incorporation into selenoproteins in the form of 21st necessary amino acid selenocysteine, to participates in the pathogenesis and intervention of chronic inflammatory diseases. Therefore, based on the safe and elemental properties of Se, we construct a facile-synthesis strategy for antiallergic selenium nanoparticles (LET-SeNPs), and scale up the production by employing a spray drying method with lactose (Lac-LET-SeNPs) or maltodextrin (Mal-LET-SeNPs) as encapsulation agents realizing larger scale production and a longer storage time. As expected, these as-prepared LET-SeNPs could effectively activate the Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway to enhance the expression of antioxidative selenoprotein at mRNA and protein levels, then inhibit mast cell activation to achieve efficient antiallergic activity. Interestingly, LET-SeNPs undergo metabolism to seleno-amino acids to promote biosynthesis of selenoproteins, which could suppress ROS-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and MAPKs activation to suppress the release of histamine and inflammatory cytokines. Allergic mouse and Macaca fascicularis models further confirm that LET-SeNPs could increase the Se content and selenoprotein expression in the skin, decrease mast cells activation and inflammatory cells infiltration, and finally exhibit the high therapeutic effects on allergic dermatitis. Taken together, this study not only constructs facile large-scale synthesis of translational Se nanomedicine to break through the bottleneck problem of nanomaterials but also sheds light on its application in the intervention and treatment of allergies.","2023-07-25","2024-07-04 22:58:46","2024-07-07 04:40:31","2024-07-04 22:57:46","14053-14068","","14","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/AYJWJK4L/Xie et al. - 2023 - Translational Selenium Nanoparticles to Attenuate .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To fill this gap, we used a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), and the determination of the intra-LNP pH gradient to analyze the nanoparticles (NPs) in BNT162b2 (Comirnaty), comparing it with the well-characterized PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil). Comirnaty NPs had similar size and envelope lipid composition to Doxil; however, unlike Doxil liposomes, wherein the stable ammonium and pH gradient enables accumulation of 14C-methylamine in the intraliposomal aqueous phase, Comirnaty LNPs lack such pH gradient in spite of the fact that the pH 4, at which LNPs are prepared, is raised to pH 7.2 after loading of the mRNA. Mechanical manipulation of Comirnaty NPs with AFM revealed soft, compliant structures. The sawtooth-like force transitions seen during cantilever retraction imply that molecular strands, corresponding to mRNA, can be pulled out of NPs, and the process is accompanied by stepwise rupture of mRNA–lipid bonds. Unlike Doxil, cryo-TEM of Comirnaty NPs revealed a granular, solid core enclosed by mono- and bilipid layers. Negative staining TEM shows 2–5 nm electron-dense spots in the LNP’s interior that are aligned into strings, semicircles, or labyrinth-like networks, which may imply cross-link-stabilized RNA fragments. The neutral intra-LNP core questions the dominance of ionic interactions holding together this scaffold, raising the possibility of hydrogen bonding between mRNA and the lipids. Such interaction, described previously for another mRNA/lipid complex, is consistent with the steric structure of the ionizable lipid in Comirnaty, ALC-0315, displaying free ═O and −OH groups. It is hypothesized that the latter groups can get into steric positions that enable hydrogen bonding with the nitrogenous bases in the mRNA.

Recently, there has been intense interest in Cu2O-based catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), owing to their capabilities in enhancing C–C coupling. However, the electrochemical instability of Cu+ in Cu2O leads to its inevitable reduction to Cu0, resulting in poor selectivity for C2+ products. Herein, we propose an unconventional and feasible strategy for stabilizing Cu+ through the construction of a Ce4+ 4f–O 2p–Cu+ 3d network structure in Ce-Cu2O. Experimental results and theoretical calculations confirm that the unconventional orbital hybridization near Ef based on the high-order Ce4+ 4f and 2p can more effectively inhibit the leaching of lattice oxygen, thereby stabilizing Cu+ in Ce-Cu2O, compared with traditional d–p hybridization. Compared to pure Cu2O, the Ce-Cu2O catalyst increased the ratio of C2H4/CO by 1.69-fold during the CO2RR at −1.3 V. Furthermore, in situ and ex situ spectroscopic techniques were utilized to track the oxidation valency of copper under CO2RR conditions with time resolution, identifying the well-maintained Cu+ species in the Ce-Cu2O catalyst. This work not only presents an avenue to CO2RR catalyst design involving the high-order 4f and 2p orbital hybridization but also provides deep insights into the metal-oxidation-state-dependent selectivity of catalysts.","2023-07-25","2024-07-04 22:58:46","2024-07-06 17:14:20","2024-07-04 22:57:51","13974-13984","","14","17","","ACS Nano","Boosting CO2 Electroreduction to C2H4 via Unconventional Hybridization","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/R35WF4KE/Sun et al. - 2023 - Boosting CO2 Electroreduction to C2H4 via Unconven.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, the crystal symmetry allows topology preserving (isoreticular) expansion of the DNA stack without breaking protein–protein contacts, hence providing larger solvent channels for guest diffusion. Experimentally, the resulting designed isoreticular cocrystal adopted an interpenetrating I222 lattice, a phenomenon previously observed in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).

In patients with diabetes mellitus, particularly, skin infections are often accompanied by a slow healing process, amputation, and even death. Timely diagnosis of skin infection strains and on-site therapy are vital in human health and safety. Herein, a double-layered “test-to-treat” pad is developed for the visual monitoring and selective treatment of drug-sensitive (DS)/drug-resistant (DR) bacterial infections. The inner layer (using carrageenan hydrogel as a scaffold) is loaded with bacteria indicators and an acid-responsive drug (Fe-carbenicillin frameworks) for infection detection and DS bacteria inactivation. The outer layer is a mechanoluminescence material (ML, CaZnOS:Mn2+) and visible-light responsive photocatalyst (Pt@TiO2) incorporated elastic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). On the basis of the colorimetric sensing result (yellow for DS-bacterial infection and red for DR-bacterial infection), a suitable antibacterial strategy is guided and then performed. Two available bactericidal routes provided by double pad layers reflect the advantage. The controllable and effective killing of DR bacteria is realized by in situ generated reactive oxygen species (ROSs) from the combination of Pt@TiO2 and ML under mechanical force, avoiding physical light sources and alleviating off-target side effects of ROS in biomedical therapy. As a proof-of-concept, the “test-to-treat” pad is applied as a wearable wound dressing for sensing and selectively dealing with DS/DR bacterial infections in vitro and in vivo. This multifunctional design effectively reduces antibiotic abuse and accelerates wound healing, providing an innovative and promising Band-Aid strategy in point-of-care diagnosis and therapy.","2023-07-25","2024-07-04 22:58:46","2024-07-07 05:28:07","2024-07-04 22:57:58","13296-13309","","14","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/HKEA3GIH/Zhao et al. - 2023 - A “Test-to-Treat” Pad for Real-Time Visual Monitor.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the severity of this disease, diagnosing plaque vulnerability remains challenging due to the lack of effective diagnostic tools. Conventional diagnostic protocols lack specificity and fail to predict the type of atherosclerotic lesion and the risk of plaque rupture. To address this issue, technologies are emerging, such as noninvasive medical imaging of atherosclerotic plaque with customized nanotechnological solutions. Modulating the biological interactions and contrast of nanoparticles in various imaging techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging, is possible through the careful design of their physicochemical properties. However, few examples of comparative studies between nanoparticles targeting different hallmarks of atherosclerosis exist to provide information about the plaque development stage. Our work demonstrates that Gd (III)-doped amorphous calcium carbonate nanoparticles are an effective tool for these comparative studies due to their high magnetic resonance contrast and physicochemical properties. In an animal model of atherosclerosis, we compare the imaging performance of three types of nanoparticles: bare amorphous calcium carbonate and those functionalized with the ligands alendronate (for microcalcification targeting) and trimannose (for inflammation targeting).

The hemostatic matrix system (Surgiflo@PCN) contains Surgiflo, a multispace structure that can be used to penetrate different shapes of tumor cavities to prevent postoperative tumor cavity hemorrhage. As well, porous palladium–copper nanoclusters (PCNs) have adjustable enzyme-like activities (oxidase, peroxidase, and catalase) responsible for formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under near-infrared (808 nm) laser irradiation. When the Surgiflo@PCN entered the resected tumor cavity, the first action was the direct killing of glioma cells via ROS and photothermal therapy (PTT). The second action was the induction of immunogenic cell death by PCN-enhanced oxidative stress and PTT, which reversed the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhanced the antitumor immune response. This eradicated residual glioma cells and prevented recurrence. The collective findings demonstrate that Surgiflo@PCN kills glioma cells directly through ROS and PTT and enhances antiglioma immunity and kills glioma cells indirectly.

Here, we describe a facile and elegant strategy that converts atRA into systemically injectable antithrombotic nanoparticles. The strategy involves the dimerization of two atRA molecules using a self-immolative boronate linker that is cleaved specifically by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to release anti-inflammatory hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HBA), followed by dimerization-induced self-assembly to generate colloidally stable nanoparticles. The boronated atRA dimeric prodrug (BRDP) could form injectable nanoparticles in the presence of fucoidan that serves as an emulsifier and a targeting ligand to P-selectin overexpressed on the damaged endothelium. In response to H2O2, fucoidan-decorated BRDP (f-BRDP) nanoassemblies dissociate to release both atRA and HBA, while scavenging H2O2. In a mouse model of ferric chloride (FeCl3)-induced carotid arterial thrombosis, f-BRDP nanoassemblies target the thrombosed vessel and significantly inhibit thrombus formation. The results demonstrate that dimerization of atRA molecules via a boronate linker enables the formation of stable nanoassemblies with several benefits: high drug loading, drug self-delivery, on-demand multiple antithrombotic actions, and simple fabrication of nanoparticles.

Developing ROS-scavenging materials to regulate the periodontium microenvironments is essential for treating periodontitis. Here, we report on creating cobalt oxide-supported Ir (CoO–Ir) as a cascade and ultrafast artificial antioxidase to alleviate local tissue inflammation and bone resorption in periodontitis. It is demonstrated that the Ir nanoclusters are uniformly supported on the CoO lattice, and there is stable chemical coupling and strong charge transfer from Co to Ir sites. Benefiting from its structural advantages, CoO–Ir presents cascade and ultrafast superoxide dismutase-catalase-like catalytic activities. Notably, it displays distinctly increased Vmax (76.249 mg L–1 min–1) and turnover number (2.736 s–1) when eliminating H2O2, which surpasses most of the by-far-reported artificial enzymes. Consequently, the CoO–Ir not only provides efficient cellular protection from ROS attack but also promotes osteogenetic differentiation in vitro. Furthermore, CoO–Ir can efficiently combat periodontitis by inhibiting inflammation-induced tissue destruction and promoting osteogenic regeneration. We believe that this report will shed meaningful light on creating cascade and ultrafast artificial antioxidases and offer an effective strategy to combat tissue inflammation and osteogenic resorption in oxidative stress-related diseases.","2023-08-08","2024-07-04 22:58:46","2024-07-07 21:54:58","2024-07-04 22:58:10","15097-15112","","15","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/JN7TIHMA/Xie et al. - 2023 - Cascade and Ultrafast Artificial Antioxidases Alle.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The scarcity, heterogeneity and intrinsic complexity of tumor EVs present a major technological challenge in real-time monitoring of complex cancers such as glioblastoma (GBM). Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) outputs a label-free spectroscopic fingerprint for EV molecular profiling. However, it has not been exploited to detect known biomarkers at the single EV level. We developed a multiplex fluidic device with embedded arrayed nanocavity microchips (MoSERS microchip) that achieves 97% confinement of single EVs in a minute amount of fluid (<10 μL) and enables molecular profiling of single EVs with SERS. The nanocavity arrays combine two featuring characteristics: (1) An embedded MoS2 monolayer that enables label-free isolation and nanoconfinement of single EVs due to physical interaction (Coulomb and van der Waals) between the MoS2 edge sites and the lipid bilayer; and (2) A layered plasmonic cavity that enables sufficient electromagnetic field enhancement inside the cavities to obtain a single EV level signal resolution for stratifying the molecular alterations. We used the GBM paradigm to demonstrate the diagnostic potential of the SERS single EV molecular profiling approach. The MoSERS multiplexing fluidic achieves parallel signal acquisition of glioma molecular variants (EGFRvIII oncogenic mutation and MGMT expression) in GBM cells. The detection limit of 1.23% was found for stratifying these key molecular variants in the wild-type population. When interfaced with a convolutional neural network (CNN), MoSERS improved diagnostic accuracy (87%) with which GBM mutations were detected in 12 patient blood samples, on par with clinical pathology tests. Thus, MoSERS demonstrates the potential for molecular stratification of cancer patients using circulating EVs.","2023-07-11","2024-07-04 22:58:46","2024-07-06 06:45:08","2024-07-04 22:58:11","12052-12071","","13","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/CV6ATQKT/Jalali et al. - 2023 - MoS2-Plasmonic Nanocavities for Raman Spectra of S.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many studies have attempted to extend the circulation of intravenously administered OVs, almost all by preventing OVs from binding to neutralizing antibodies and complements in the blood, but the results have not been satisfactory. In contrast to previous conclusions, we found that the key to improving the circulation of OVs is to prevent the formation of the virus-protein corona rather than simply preventing the binding of neutralizing antibodies or complements to OVs. After identifying the key protein components of the virus-protein corona, we proposed a virus-protein corona replacement strategy, where an artificial virus-protein corona was formed on OVs to completely prevent the interaction of OVs with key virus-protein corona components in the plasma. It was found that this strategy dramatically prolonged the circulation time of OVs by over 30 fold and increased the distribution of OVs in tumors by over 10-fold, resulting in superior antitumor efficacy in primary and metastatic tumor models.

The Magneto-Archimedes effect based (Mag-Arch) strategy can modulate cell locomotion directly without impelling inks. In a paramagnetic medium, cells were repelled from high magnetic strength zones due to their innate diamagnetism, which is independent of substrate properties. However, Mag-Arch has not been developed into a powerful bioprinting strategy as its precision, complexity, and throughput are limited by magnetic field distribution. By controlling the paramagnetic reagent concentration in the medium and the gaps between magnets, which decide the cell repelling scope of magnets, we created simultaneously more than a hundred micrometer scale identical assemblies into designed patterns (such as alphabets) with single/multiple cell types. Cell patterning models for cell migration and immune cell adhesion studies were conveniently created by Mag-Arch. As a proof of concept, we patterned a tumor/endothelial coculture model within a covered microfluidic channel to mimic epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) under shear stress in a cancer pathological environment, which gave a potential solution to pattern multiple cell types in a confined space without any premodification.

However, their unrestricted range of motion does not capture the limited movement and bond directionality that is instead typical of real molecules. In this work, we create flexible colloidal molecules with an in situ controllable motion range and bond directionality by assembling spherical particles onto cubes functionalized with complementary surface-mobile DNA. By varying the sphere-to-cube size ratio, we obtain colloidal molecules with different coordination numbers and find that they feature a constrained range of motion above a critical size ratio. Using theory and simulations, we show that the particle shape together with the multivalent bonds creates an effective free-energy landscape for the motion of the sphere on the surface of the cube. We quantify the confinement of the spheres on the surface of the cube and the probability to change facet. We find that temperature can be used as an extra control parameter to switch in situ between full and constrained flexibility.

The coencapsulation of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) using biomimetic silica as an entrapment matrix was optimized to obtain nanosized hybrids (∼150 nm) for remote activation of the therapeutic enzyme. HRP converts indole-3-acetic acid (3IAA) into peroxylated radicals, whereas MNPs respond to alternating magnetic fields (AMFs) becoming local hotspots. The AMF application triggered an increase in the bioconversion rate of HRP matching the activity displayed at the optimal temperature of the nHs (Topt = 50 °C) without altering the temperature of the reaction media. This showed that enzyme nanoactuation is possible with MNPs even if they are not covalently bound. After an extensive physicochemical/magnetic characterization, the spatial location of each component of the nH was deciphered, and an insulating role of the silica matrix was suggested as critical for introducing remote control over HRP. In vitro assays, using a human pancreatic cancer cell line (MIA PaCa-2), showed that only upon exposure to AMF and in the presence of the prodrug, the enzyme-loaded nHs triggered cell death. Moreover, in vivo experiments showed higher reductions in the tumor volume growth in those animals treated with nHs in the presence of 3IAA when exposed to AMF.

It has become increasingly evident that the proinflammatory microenvironment of the plaque, characterized by heightened monocyte recruitment, oxidative stress, and impaired clearance of apoptotic cells, plays a significant role in perpetuating inflammation and impeding its resolution. Consequently, targeting and eliminating these proinflammatory features within the plaque microenvironment have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach to restore inflammation resolution and mitigate the progression of atherosclerosis. While recent advancements in nanotherapeutics have demonstrated promising results in targeting individual proinflammatory characteristics, the development of an effective therapeutic strategy capable of simultaneously addressing multiple proinflammatory features remains a challenge. In this study, we developed a multifunctional nanozyme based on Prussian blue, termed PBNZ@PP-Man, to simultaneously target and eliminate various proinflammatory factors within the plaque microenvironment. Through systematic investigations, we have elucidated the antiatherosclerotic mechanisms of PBNZ@PP-Man. Our results demonstrate that PBNZ@PP-Man possesses the ability to accumulate within atherosclerotic plaques and effectively eliminate multiple proinflammatory factors, leading to inflammation resolution. Specifically, PBNZ@PP-Man suppresses monocyte recruitment, scavenges reactive oxygen species, and enhances efferocytosis. Notably, PBNZ@PP-Man exhibits a much stronger efficacy to resolve the proinflammatory plaque microenvironment and attenuate atherosclerosis in comparison to the approach that merely eliminates one single risky factor in the plaque. It significantly enhances the inflammation resolution capabilities of macrophages and attenuates atherosclerosis.

As a result, the optimal Sb-modified NCA delivers a high capacity retention of 94.6% after 200 cycles at 1 C and a good rate capacity of 183.9 mAh g–1 at 10 C, which is expected to be applied to next-generation advanced LIBs.","2023-07-11","2024-07-04 22:58:46","2024-07-07 17:54:42","2024-07-04 22:58:24","12759-12773","","13","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/BCYGE96Q/Ni et al. - 2023 - Multiscale Crystal Field Effect for High-Performan.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a local ablative technique for the clinical treatment of solid tumors, including locally advanced and unresectable PDAC, by intratumorally delivering high-intensity electric pulses to permanently disrupt cell membranes and induce cell death. But the distribution of electric field is uneven within the tumor, and in some regions, tumor cells only experience temporary perturbation to their cell membrane, a phenomenon denoted as reversible electroporation (RE). These tumor cells may survive and therefore are the main culprit of tumor relapse after IRE. We herein showed that RE, although not killing tumor cells, induced DNA double-strand breaks and activated DNA damage repair (DDR) responses. Using reactive oxygen species-sensitive polymeric micelles coloaded with Olaparib, an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and AZD0156, an inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), the resultant nanoformulation (M-TK-OA) disrupted both homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining signaling of the DDR response and impaired colony formation in pancreatic cancer cells after RE. The combination of IRE and M-TK-OA significantly prolonged animal survival in both subcutaneous and orthotopic murine PDAC models and elicited CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity with a sustained antitumor memory. The efficacy of combined IRE and M-TK-OA treatments was partially attributed to the activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes innate immune responses. Our study suggests that dual inhibition of PARP and ATM with nanomedicine is a promising strategy to enhance the pancreatic cancer response to IRE.","2023-07-11","2024-07-04 22:58:46","2024-07-07 18:49:44","2024-07-04 22:58:26","12915-12932","","13","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/A3TMESJU/Long et al. - 2023 - Simultaneous Delivery of Dual Inhibitors of DNA Da.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We engineered nanosized immunofilaments (IFs), with a soluble semiflexible polyisocyanopeptide backbone that presents peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complexes and costimulatory molecules multivalently. IFs readily activated and expanded antigen-specific T cells like natural APCs, as evidenced by transcriptomic analyses of T cells. Upon intravenous injection, IFs reach the spleen and lymph nodes and induce antigen-specific T cell responses in vivo. Moreover, IFs display strong antitumor efficacy resulting in inhibition of the formation of melanoma metastases and reduction of primary tumor growth in synergy with immune checkpoint blockade.

After the occurrence of MI, the heart frequently undergoes serious pathological remodeling, leading to excessive dilation, electrical disconnection between cardiac cells, and fatal functional damage. Hence, extensive efforts have been made to suppress pathological remodeling and promote the repair of the infarcted heart. In this study, we developed a hydrogel cardiac patch that can provide mechanical support, electrical conduction, and tissue adhesiveness to aid in the recovery of an infarcted heart function. Specifically, we developed a conductive and adhesive hydrogel (CAH) by combining the two-dimensional titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene with natural biocompatible polymers [i.e., gelatin and dextran aldehyde (dex-ald)]. The CAH was formed within 250 s of mixing the precursor solution and could be painted. The hydrogel containing 3.0 mg/mL MXene, 10% gelatin, and 5% dex-ald exhibited appropriate material characteristics for cardiac patch applications, including a uniform distribution of MXene, a high electrical conductivity (18.3 mS/cm), cardiac tissue-like elasticity (30.4 kPa), strong tissue adhesion (6.8 kPa), and resistance to various mechanical deformations. The CAH was cytocompatible and induced cardiomyocyte (CM) maturation in vitro, as indicated by the upregulation of connexin 43 expression and a faster beating rate. Furthermore, CAH could be painted onto the heart tissue and remained stably adhered to the beating epicardium. In vivo animal studies revealed that CAH cardiac patch treatment significantly improved cardiac function and alleviated the pathological remodeling of an infarcted heart. Thus, we believe that our MXene-based CAH can potentially serve as a promising platform for the effective repair of various electroactive tissues including the heart, muscle, and nerve tissues.","2023-07-11","2024-07-04 22:58:46","2024-07-07 05:28:00","2024-07-04 22:58:31","12290-12304","","13","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/AHV735YA/Lee et al. - 2023 - A Conductive and Adhesive Hydrogel Composed of MXe.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, AmGd-NPs could synergize with RT to enhance immunogenic cell death, improve phagocytosis, and promote antigen presentation.

Since the size and shape of these oligomers influence their toxicity, their biophysical characterization is essential for a better understanding of the structure–toxicity relationship. Amyloid oligomers are difficult to characterize by conventional approaches due to their heterogeneity in size and shape, their dynamic aggregation process, and their low abundance. This work demonstrates that resistive pulse measurements using polymer-coated solid-state nanopores enable single-particle-level characterization of the size and shape of individual αSyn oligomers in solution within minutes. A comparison of the resulting size distribution with single-particle analysis by transmission electron microscopy and mass photometry reveals good agreement with superior resolution by nanopore-based characterization. Moreover, nanopore-based analysis has the capability to combine rapid size analysis with an approximation of the oligomer shape. Applying this shape approximation to putatively toxic oligomeric species that range in size from 18 ± 7 aggregated monomers (10S) to 29 ± 10 aggregated monomers (15S) and in concentration from picomolar to nanomolar revealed oligomer shapes that agree well with previous estimates by cryo-EM with the added advantage that nanopore-based analysis occurs rapidly, in solution, and has the potential to become a widely accessible technique.","2023-07-11","2024-07-04 22:58:46","2024-07-06 06:45:18","2024-07-04 22:58:34","12325-12335","","13","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/QR4ELLTR/Awasthi et al. - 2023 - Simultaneous Determination of the Size and Shape o.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Addressing chronic joint inflammation, lubrication dysfunction, and cartilage-tissue degradation simultaneously may hopefully tackle this challenge. Herein, we developed superlubricative zein@alginate/strontium@calcitriol (ZASC) nanospheres to treat advanced OA. ZASC was confirmed to significantly improve joint lubrication through traditional tribological tests and our proposed tribological experiment to mimic the intra-articular condition based on the human medial tibiofemoral joint tissues. This finding was attributed to the hydration lubrication formed around the alginate-strontium spheres that enabled ball-bearing lubrication and the filling of cartilage defects. Moreover, ZASCs that released calcitriol in a sustained manner showed proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptosis effects in vitro. Further experiments demonstrated that ZASC exerted chondroprotective effects by inhibiting the breakdown of the extracellular matrix in patient-derived OA cartilage explants. In vivo results demonstrated that ZASC can effectively maintain a normal gait to improve joint function, inhibit abnormal bone remodeling and cartilage degradation in early OA and can effectively reverse the advanced OA progression. Therefore, ZASC is a potentially nonsurgical therapeutic strategy for advanced OA treatments.","2023-07-11","2024-07-04 22:58:46","2024-07-07 17:54:25","2024-07-04 22:58:37","12842-12861","","13","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/NKJELX5Z/Xie et al. - 2023 - Calcitriol-Loaded Multifunctional Nanospheres with.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These rely on the manipulation of charges at multiple interfaces. However, at present, submicrometer variations in strain, doping, or electrical breakages may exist undetected within a device, adversely affecting macroscale performance. Here, we use conductive mode and cathodoluminescence scanning electron microscopy (CM-SEM and SEM-CL) to investigate these phenomena. As a model system, we use a monolayer WSe2 (1L-WSe2) encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). CM-SEM allows for quantification of the flow of electrons during the SEM measurements. During electron irradiation at 5 keV, up to 70% of beam electrons are deposited into the vdW-HS and can subsequently migrate to the 1L-WSe2. This accumulation of charge leads to dynamic doping of 1L-WSe2, reducing its CL efficiency by up to 30% over 30 s. By providing a path for excess electrons to leave the sample, near full restoration of the initial CL signal can be achieved. These results indicate that the trapping of charges in vdW-HSs during electron irradiation must be considered, in order to obtain and maintain optimal performance of vdW-HS devices during processes such as e-beam lithography or SEM. Thus, CM-SEM and SEM-CL form a toolkit through which nanoscale characterization of vdW-HS devices can be performed, allowing electrical and optical properties to be correlated.","2023-06-27","2024-07-04 22:58:46","2024-07-06 06:53:56","2024-07-04 22:58:42","11882-11891","","12","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/XELCVHSQ/Ramsden et al. - 2023 - Nanoscale Cathodoluminescence and Conductive Mode .pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We optimize the structural properties of all these monolayers and explore their electronic structure with a particular emphasis on those rare large-bandgap 2D materials that could be precious in isolating 2D field-effect-transistor channels.

Herein, a multiple stimuli-responsive nanoCRISPR (Must-nano) with spatial arrangement peculiarities in nanostructure and intracellular delivery is fabricated to overcome redox heterogeneity at both genetic and phenotypic levels for tumor-specific activatable PDT. Must-nano consists of a redox-sensitive core loading CRISPR/Cas9 targeting hypoxia-inducible factors-1α (HIF-1α) and a rationally designed multiple-responsive shell anchored by chlorin e6 (Ce6). Benefiting from the perfect coordination of structure and function, Must-nano avoids enzyme/photodegradation of the CRISPR/Cas9 system and exerts prolonged circulation, precise tumor recognition, and cascade-responsive performances to surmount tumor extra/intracellular barriers. After internalization into tumor cells, Must-nano could undergo hyaluronidase-triggered self-disassembly with charge reversal and rapid endosomal escape, followed by site-specific release and spatially asynchronous delivery of Ce6 and CRISPR/Cas9 under stimulations of redox signals, which not only improves tumor vulnerability to oxidative stress by complete HIF-1α disruption but also destroys the intrinsic antioxidant mechanism through glutathione depletion, thereby homogenizing redox-heterogeneous cells into oxidative stress-sensitive cell subsets. Under laser irradiation, Must-nano eventually exhibits optimal potency to amplify oxidative damage, effectively inhibiting the growth and hypoxia survival of redox-heterogeneous tumor in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our redox homogenization tactic significantly maximizes PDT efficacy and offers a promising strategy to overcome tumor redox heterogeneity in the development of antitumor therapies.","2023-06-27","2024-07-04 22:58:46","2024-07-08 01:10:05","2024-07-04 22:58:45","11414-11426","","12","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/LMFYMXVJ/Yang et al. - 2023 - A Multiple Stimuli-Responsive NanoCRISPR Overcomes.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is urgent to explore an efficient antibacterial strategy owing to the increase of drug resistance, virulence, and pathogenicity of MRSA. It was found that Fe3O4 can induce ferroptosis in MRSA, but its effect was inhibited by glutathione (GSH) to a certain extent, while cinnamaldehyde (CA) can enhance ferroptosis by consuming GSH. As a bacterial quorum sensing (QS) inhibitor, CA can suppress the QS system and further exert its antibacterial and antibiofilm effects. Here, we developed an Fe3O4-based ferroptosis inducer to promote ferroptosis in MRSA, interrupt the QS, destroy biofilm, and thus effectively treat acute MRSA pneumonia. We used sodium alginate (SA) to wrap Fe3O4 and CA to form particles, and then coated the surface with a hybrid biomimetic membrane composed of an erythrocyte membrane and platelet membrane to obtain lung targeted antibacterial particles (mFe-CA). Under ultrasonic (US) stimulation, mFe-CA can efficiently release Fe3O4 and CA, thereby synergically inducing MRSA death with the characteristics of ferroptosis, including mass ROS production, lipid peroxidation, GSH depletion, and respiratory chain suppression. Furthermore, mFe-CA + US can inhibit the QS system, remove biofilms, and reduce strain virulence. In the mouse model of MRSA pneumonia, mFe-CA + US treatment markedly advanced the survival rate of the mice, reduced the bacterial load in the lungs, and alleviated the inflammatory damage, but there was no obvious toxicity. This study proposes an antibacterial substitute to induce ferroptosis of MRSA, which may provide a foreground for overcoming microbial drug resistance and fighting biofilm-associated infections and also provides a target and theoretical basis for clinical treatment of acute MRSA pneumonia.","2023-06-27","2024-07-04 23:01:00","2024-07-08 00:06:00","2024-07-04 22:59:20","11692-11712","","12","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ZLBGHE9Z/Hu et al. - 2023 - Hybrid Biomimetic Membrane Coated Particles-Mediat.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stable, controllable, and homogeneous formation of protein nanoparticles, which is key to successfully delivering cargo intracellularly, has been challenging to achieve using conventional methods. In order to address this issue, we employed droplet microfluidics and utilized the characteristic of rapid and continuous mixing within microdroplets in order to produce highly monodisperse protein nanoparticles. We exploit the naturally occurring vortex flows within microdroplets to prevent nanoparticle aggregation following nucleation, resulting in systematic control over the particle size and monodispersity. Through combination of simulation and experiment, we find that the internal vortex velocity within microdroplets determines the uniformity of the protein nanoparticles, and by varying parameters such as protein concentration and flow rates, we are able to finely tune nanoparticle dimensional properties. Finally, we show that our nanoparticles are highly biocompatible with HEK-293 cells, and through confocal microscopy, we determine that the nanoparticles fully enter into the cell with almost all cells containing them.

Gal-NC increases the intratumoral population of cytotoxic T cells, the main effector cells of antitumor immunity, via re-educated TAMs. These TME alterations synergistically enhance the T-cell-mediated antitumor response induced by αPD-1 administration, suggesting that Gal-NC has potential value as an adjuvant for immune checkpoint blockade combination therapies.

However, most conventional physically cross-linked thermogels generally have relatively low stiffness, which limits various biomedical applications, particularly for stem-cell-based studies. While chemical cross-linking through double-network (DN) structures can increase the stiffness of the hydrogel, they generally lack injectable and thermoresponsive properties due to strong covalent bonds between molecules. To address this challenge, we have developed a temperature-induced nanostructure transition (TINT) system for preparing physical DN supramolecular hydrogels. These hydrogels possess injectable, thermoreversible characteristics and relatively high storage modulus (G′), which increases ∼14-fold from 20 to 37 °C (body temperature). Our bottom-up strategy is based on the co-assembly of aromatic peptide (Ben-FF) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to form a thermogel at 37 °C through a nanofiber dissociation pathway that differs from the well-known micelle aggregation or polymer shrinkage mechanisms. Peptide molecules form helical packing and weak, noncovalent interactions with PEG, resulting in co-assembled metastable nanofibers. Thermal perturbation initiates lateral dissociation of nanofibers into extensively cross-linked DN nanostructures and subsequent hydrogelation (ΔG = −13.32 kJ/mol). The TINT hydrogel is nontoxic to human mesenchymal stem cells and supports enhanced cell adhesion, suggesting the potential of this strategy in the applications of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.","2023-06-27","2024-07-04 23:01:00","2024-07-08 01:53:50","2024-07-04 22:59:26","11805-11816","","12","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/CPMLMZZF/Chakravarthy et al. - 2023 - Temperature-Induced Nanostructure Transition for S.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, a strategy of ROS storm generation specifically initiated by the TME and our developed nanoplatforms (TAF-HMON-CuP@PPDG) is proposed for high-performance FT of tumors. The GSH in the TME initiates HMON degradation, resulting in tamoxifen (TAF) and copper peroxide (CuP) release from TAF3-HMON-CuP3@PPDG. The released TAF leads to enhanced acidification within tumor cells, which reacts with the released CuP producing Cu2+ and H2O2. The Fenton-like reaction between Cu2+ and H2O2 generates ROS and Cu+, and that between Cu+ and H2O2 generates ROS and Cu2+, forming a cyclic catalysis effect. Cu2+ reacts with GSH to generate Cu+ and GSSG. The increased acidification by TAF can accelerate the Fenton-like reaction between Cu+ and H2O2.

Either modulating macrophages or destroying neutrophil counts cannot guarantee a satisfactory outcome in ARDS treatment. Aimed at inhibiting the coordinated action of neutrophils and macrophages and modulating the hyper-inflammatory condition, an inhalable biomimetic sequential drug-releasing nanoplatform was developed for the combinatorial treatment of ALI. The nanoplatform (termed D-SEL) was made by conjugating DNase I, as outer cleavable arms, to a serum exosomal and liposomal hybrid nanocarrier (termed SEL) via a matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9)-cleavable peptide and then encapsulating methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPS). In lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced ALI in mice, the MPS/D-SEL moved through muco-obstructive airways and was retained in the alveoli for over 24 h postinhalation. DNase I was then released from the nanocarrier first after responding to MMP-9, resulting in inner SEL core exposure, which precisely delivered MPS into macrophages for promoting M2 macrophage polarization. Local and sustained DNase I release degraded dysregulated neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and suppressed neutrophil activation and the mucus plugging microenvironment, which in turn amplified M2 macrophage polarization efficiency. Such dual-stage drug release behavior facilitated down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung but anti-inflammatory cytokine production through remodeling lung immune homeostasis, ultimately promoting lung tissue repair.

For this purpose, the orientation of the antibody on the nanoparticle is crucial to maximize fragment antibody-binding (Fab) exposure and thus antigen binding. Moreover, the exposure of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain may lead to the engagement of immune cells through one of the Fc receptors. Therefore, the choice of the chemistry for nanoparticle-antibody conjugation is key for the biological performance, and methods have been developed for orientation-selective functionalization. Despite the importance of this issue, there is a lack of direct methods to quantify the antibodies’ orientation on the nanoparticle’s surface. Here, we present a generic methodology that enables for multiplexed, simultaneous imaging of both Fab and Fc exposure on the surface of nanoparticles, based on super-resolution microscopy. Fab-specific Protein M and Fc-specific Protein G probes were conjugated to single stranded DNAs and two-color DNA-PAINT imaging was performed. Hereby, we quantitatively addressed the number of sites per particle and highlight the heterogeneity in the Ab orientation and compared the results with a geometrical computational model to validate data interpretation. Moreover, super-resolution microscopy can resolve particle size, allowing the study of how particle dimensions affect antibody coverage. We show that different conjugation strategies modulate the Fab and Fc exposure which can be tuned depending on the application of choice. Finally, we explored the biomedical importance of antibody domain exposure in antibody dependent cell mediated phagocytosis (ADCP).

The outer surface of the nanochannels were modified with amphipathic peptide probe consisting of hydrophilic unit (CRRRR), MMP-2 cleavage unit (PLGLAG), and hydrophobic unit (Fn). After recognition of MMP-2, due to the release of hydrophobic unit, the hydrophilicity of the outer surface was expected to increase, thus leading to the increase of ion current. Furthermore, the number (n) of phenylalanine (F) in the hydrophobic unit was modulated from 2, 4, to 6. By lengthening the hydrophobic unit, the limit of detection for MMP-2 detection could reach 1 ng/mL (when n = 6) and improve by 50-fold (to n = 2). This nanochannel system was utilized to successfully detect the MMP-2 secreted from cells and demonstrated that the expression of MMP-2 was related to the cell cycle and exhibited the highest level in G1/S phase.

A significant challenge for LNP development is insufficient understanding of structure–activity relationship (SAR). Small changes in chemical composition and process parameters can affect LNP structure, significantly impacting performance in vitro and in vivo. The choice of polyethylene glycol lipid (PEG-lipid), one of the essential lipids for LNP, has been proven to govern particle size. Here we find that PEG-lipids can further modify the core organization of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-loaded LNPs to govern its gene silencing activity. Furthermore, we also have found that the extent of compartmentalization, measured by the ratio of disordered vs ordered inverted hexagonal phases within an ASO-lipid core, is predictive of in vitro gene silencing. In this work, we propose that a lower ratio of disordered/ordered core phases correlates with stronger gene knockdown efficacy. To establish these findings, we developed a seamless high-throughput screening approach that integrated an automated LNP formulation system with structural analysis by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and in vitro TMEM106b mRNA knockdown assessment. We applied this approach to screen 54 ASO-LNP formulations while varying the type and concentration of PEG-lipids. Representative formulations with diverse SAXS profiles were further visualized using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to help structural elucidation. The proposed SAR was built by combining this structural analysis with in vitro data.

Here, we present an analytical technique to provide such information, while measuring the nanocarrier and cargo simultaneously with label-free, nondestructive single particle automated Raman trapping analysis (SPARTA). We first synthesized a library of model compounds covering a range of hydrophilicities and providing distinct Raman signals. These compounds were then loaded into model nanovesicles (polymersomes) that can load both hydrophobic and hydrophilic cargo into the membrane or core regions, respectively. Using our analytical framework, we characterized the heterogeneity of the population by correlating the signal per particle from the membrane and cargo.

The grown films can be exfoliated to form freestanding membranes, although it is often challenging to apply this technique if the substrate materials are prone to damage under harsh epitaxy conditions. For example, remote epitaxy of GaN thin films on graphene/GaN templates has not been achieved by a standard metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method due to such damages. Here, we report GaN remote heteroepitaxy on graphene/AlN templates by MOCVD and investigate the influence of surface pits in AlN on the growth and exfoliation of GaN thin films. We first show the thermal stability of graphene before GaN growth, based on which two-step growth of GaN on graphene/AlN is developed. The GaN samples are successfully exfoliated after the first step of the growth at 750 °C, whereas the exfoliation failed after the second step at 1050 °C. In-depth analysis confirms that the pits in AlN templates lead to the degradation of graphene near the area and thus the alteration of growth modes and the failure of exfoliation. These results exemplify the importance of chemical and topographic properties of growth templates for successful remote epitaxy. It is one of the key factors for III-nitride-based remote epitaxy, and these results are expected to be of great help in realizing complete remote epitaxy using only MOCVD.","2023-06-27","2024-07-04 23:01:00","2024-07-07 06:48:37","2024-07-04 22:59:37","11739-11748","","12","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/YKXK7Y68/Kwak et al. - 2023 - Stability of Graphene and Influence of AlN Surface.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To solve the above clinical predicaments, a glutathione (GSH) exhausting virus-like silicon dioxide nanoprobe with Gd coating and folic acid (FA) modification is designed.

Moreover, after the nanoprobes enter into the cytoplasm of cancer cells, tetrasulfide linkages in the silica framework are broken under the triggering of high GSH concentrations. In turn, the broken framework exhausts GSH to disrupt intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, and Gd produces more ROS under radiotherapy, further activating ferroptosis, and resulting in the enhancement of radiotherapy in breast cancer.

This work reveals that the mixed valence of vanadium (VIV and VV) in PMVL triggers ferroptosis due to the self-cyclic valence alteration of V, the process of which generates •OH for lipid peroxide accumulation (VIV → VV) and depletes glutathione (GSH) for glutathione peroxidase (GPX4) deactivation (VV → VIV). Notably, LND strengthens ferroptosis by dual suppression of glycolysis (decreasing ATP supply) and the pentose phosphate pathway (decreasing NADPH production), causing anabatic GSH consumption. Besides, the inhibited glycolysis generates less intracellular lactic acid and alleviates the acidity of tumor microenvironment, preventing immunosuppressive M2 macrophage polarization.

Here, we propose the application of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating nanoparticles as nanobiostimulants to trigger stress/immune responses and subsequently increase the stress resilience of plants. We established three regimens of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)-based “stress training”: seed training (ST), leaf training (LT), and combined seed and leaf training (SLT). Trained rice seedlings were then exposed to either rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae) or chilling stress (10 °C). The results show that all “stress training” regimes, particularly SLT, significantly enhanced the resistance of rice against the fungal pathogen (lesion size reduced by 82% relative to untrained control). SLT also significantly enhanced rice tolerance to cold stress. The mechanisms for the enhanced resilience were investigated with metabolomics and transcriptomics, which show that “stress training” induced considerable metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming in rice leaves. AgNPs boosted ROS-activated stress signaling pathways by oxidative post-translational modifications of stress-related kinases, hormones, and transcriptional factors (TFs). These signaling pathways subsequently modulated the expression of defense genes, including specialized metabolites (SMs) biosynthesis genes, cell membrane lipid metabolism genes, and pathogen–plant interaction genes. Importantly, results showed that the “stress memory” can be transferred transgenerationally, conferring offspring seeds with improved seed germination and seedling vigor. This may provide an epigenetic breeding strategy to fortify stress resilience of crops.

We then identified 13 key attributes, including concentration, serum, cell, size, time, surface, and assay type, which can explain SiO2-NP toxicity, using the Shapley Additive exPlanation values in the CatBoost model. The serum attribute underscores the importance of nanoparticle–corona complexes for nanotoxicity prediction. We further show that internal validation does not guarantee generalizability.

Here, we propose a perspective strategy of using a multipotent gallium-based liquid metal (LM) nanoplatform for personalized in situ cancer vaccines (ISCVs). The antigen-capturing and immunostimulatory LM nanoplatform can not only effectively destroy orthotopic tumors to generate multifarious autologous antigens upon external energy stimulation (photothermal/photodynamic effect) but also capture and transport antigens into dendritic cells (DCs) to enhance antigen utilization (adequate DCs uptake, antigen-endo/lysosomal escape) and facilitate DCs activation (mimic alum immunoadjuvant capacity), which ultimately awaken systemic antitumor immunity (expand cytotoxic T lymphocytes and modulate tumor microenvironment). With immune checkpoint blockade (anti-PD-L1) to further relieve the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, the positive tumoricidal immunity feedback loop was established to effectively eliminate orthotopic tumors, inhibit abscopal tumor growth, relapse, and metastasis as well as tumor-specific prevention. Collectively, this study demonstrates the potential of a multipotent LM nanoplatform for personalized ISCVs, which will open frontier exploration of LM-based immunostimulatory biomaterials and may encourage further investigation of precise individualized immunotherapy.","2023-07-25","2024-07-04 23:01:00","2024-07-07 17:54:36","2024-07-04 22:59:50","13278-13295","","14","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/KKKLSQLE/Wang et al. - 2023 - Liquid Metal Nanoplatform Based Autologous Cancer .pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The HIV-1 Cas13 assay was designed, validated, and optimized. We evaluated the analytical performances with synthetic RNAs.

However, the application of quorum sensing inhibitors (QSI) is strongly restricted by poor water-solubility and low bioavailability. We herein fabricate pH-sensitive curcumin (Cur) loaded clustered nanoparticles with active targeting ability (denoted as anti-CD54@Cur-DA NPs) to inhibit QS for enhanced antibiotic therapy. Cur-DA NPs are first prepared through electrostatic interaction between Cur loaded amino-ended poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (PAMAM) and 2,3-dimethyl maleic anhydride (DA) modified biotin-poly(ethylene glycol)-polylysine (biotin-PEG-PLys). Anti-CD54@Cur-DA NPs are then obtained by the modification of Cur-DA NPs with anti-CD54. Cur loaded PAMAM can be released from Cur-DA NPs in acidic pH, leading to simultaneous charge reversal and size decrease, which is beneficial for biofilm penetration. Cur-DA NPs are hence much better in inhibiting QS than free Cur due to enhanced biofilm penetration. Compared to free Cur, Cur-DA NPs exhibit stronger capability in inhibiting the development of biofilm architecture and maturation, thus downregulating efflux pump-related genes and improving bactericidal performance of multiple antibiotics, including Penicillin G, ciprofloxacin, and tobramycin. Moreover, since anti-CD54 can selectively bind to inflamed endothelial cells, anti-CD54@Cur-DA NPs can be targeted accumulated in bacteria-infected tissues. The sequential treatment using anti-CD54@Cur-DA NPs and free antibiotics can effectively reduce bacterial burden and alleviate inflammation in a chronic lung infection model in vivo. This research provides an effective way to improve the therapeutic performance of QSI to enhance the anti-biofilm effects of antibiotics, which radiate a vitality of conventional antibiotics in treating biofilm-associated bacterial infections.","2023-06-13","2024-07-04 23:01:00","2024-07-07 22:35:29","2024-07-04 22:59:53","10019-10032","","11","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/MYICG7XZ/Chen et al. - 2023 - Inhibiting Quorum Sensing by Active Targeted pH-Se.pdf","","Log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the combination of kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations and the restrictive percolation model, three different growth modes in electrochemical metallization (ECM) cells were dynamically reproduced, and an important parameter, the relative nucleation distance, was theoretically defined to measure different growth modes quantitatively; hence their transition can be well described. In our KMC simulations, the inhomogeneity of storage medium is realized through introducing evolutionary void versus non-void sites within it to mimic the real nucleation during filament growth. Finally, the renormalization group method was used in the percolation model to analytically illustrate void-concentration-dependent growth mode transition, fitting KMC simulation results quite well. Our study found that the nanostructure of the medium can dominate the filament growth dynamics, as the simulation images as well as the analytical results are consistent with experiments results. Our study spotlights a vital and intrinsic factor, void concentration (relative to defects, grains, or nanopores) of a storage medium, in inducing filament growth mode transition within ECM cells.

Herein, we present HEA-NP catalysts that are tightly sunk in an oxide overlayer for promoting the catalytic conversion of CO2 with exceptional stability and performance. We demonstrated the controlled formation of conformal oxide overlayers on carbon nanofiber surfaces via a simple sol–gel method, which facilitated a large uptake of metal precursor ions and helped to decrease the reaction temperature required for nanoparticle formation. During the rapid thermal shock synthesis process, the oxide overlayer would also impede nanoparticle growth, resulting in uniformly distributed small HEA-NPs (2.37 ± 0.78 nm). Moreover, these HEA-NPs were firmly socketed in the reducible oxide overlayer, enabling an ultrastable catalytic performance involving >50% CO2 conversion with >97% selectivity to CO for >300 h without extensive agglomeration. Altogether, we establish the rational design principles for the thermal shock synthesis of high-entropy alloy nanoparticles and offer a helpful mechanistic perspective on how the oxide overlayer impacts the nanoparticle synthesis behavior, providing a general platform for the designed synthesis of ultrastable and high-performance catalysts that could be utilized for various industrially and environmentally relevant chemical processes.","2023-07-11","2024-07-04 23:01:00","2024-07-07 17:54:46","2024-07-04 22:59:57","12188-12199","","13","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/TXPNNPSI/Ahn et al. - 2023 - Rapid Joule Heating Synthesis of Oxide-Socketed Hi.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we report an approach to build chiral metal–organic networks using 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) molecules and low-cost sodium chloride (NaCl) in a controllable manner on Au(111). The chirality induction and transfer processes during network evolution with increased Na ion ratios were captured by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT) methodologies. Our findings show that Na ion incorporation into achiral PTCDA molecules partially breaks intermolecular hydrogen bonds and coordinates with carboxyl oxygen atoms, which initiates a collective sliding motion of PTCDA molecules along specific directions. Consequently, “molecular columns” linked by hydrogen bonds were formed in the rearranged Na-PTCDA networks. Notably, the direction of Na ion incorporation determines the chiral characteristic by guiding the sliding direction of the molecular columns, and chirality can be transferred from Na0.5PTCDA to Na1PTCDA networks. Furthermore, our results indicate that the chirality transferring process is disrupted when intermolecular hydrogen bonds are entirely replaced by Na ions at a high Na dopant concentration.

Anthropometric and imaging approaches are primarily used to assess adiposity, and there is a dearth of techniques to determine the changes in adipose tissue (AT) at the molecular level. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a novel and less invasive source of biomarkers for various pathologies. Furthermore, the possibility of enriching cell or tissue-specific EVs from the biofluids based on their unique surface markers has led to classifying these vesicles as “liquid biopsies”, offering valuable molecular information on hard-to-access tissues. Here, we isolated small EVs from AT (sEVAT) of lean and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, identified unique surface proteins on sEVAT by surface shaving followed by mass spectrometry, and developed a signature of five unique proteins. Using this signature, we pulled out sEVAT from the blood of mice and validated the specificity of isolated sEVAT by measuring the expression of adiponectin, 38 adipokines on an array, and several adipose tissue-related miRNAs. Furthermore, we provided evidence of sEV applicability in disease prediction by characterizing sEVAT from the blood of lean and DIO mice. Interestingly, sEVAT-DIO cargo showed a stronger pro-inflammatory effect on THP1 monocytes compared to sEVAT-Lean and a significant increase in obesity-associated miRNA expression. Equally important, sEVAT cargo revealed an obesity-associated aberrant amino acid metabolism that was subsequently validated in the corresponding AT. Lastly, we show a significant increase in inflammation-related molecules in sEVAT isolated from the blood of nondiabetic obese (>30 kg/m2) individuals. Overall, the present study offers a less-invasive approach to characterize AT.","2023-06-13","2024-07-04 23:01:00","2024-07-08 00:42:57","2024-07-04 23:00:02","10252-10268","","11","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/CW8JN8NL/Mishra et al. - 2023 - A Liquid Biopsy-Based Approach to Isolate and Char.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, in this work, self-assembled spermidine-based metal-immunopeptide nanocomplexes (APP-Fe NCs; APP is anti-programmed death ligand-1 peptide) with pH-responsive release kinetics were prepared via the flash nanocomplexation (FNC) technique based on the noncovalent interaction between APP-SPM-dextran (DEX) and sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) and coordination between Fe3+ and TPP. An in vitro study suggested that APP-Fe NCs effectively induce strong oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequently lead to ferroptosis in cells by interfering with homeostasis in lymphoma cells. Further investigation on lymphoma mice models demonstrated that APP-Fe NCs effectively inhibited the growth and liver metastasis of lymphomas. Mechanistically, by triggering ferroptosis in tumor tissues, these spermidine-containing APP-Fe NCs efficiently facilitated the release of DAMPs and ultimately reshaped TME to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in lymphoma. Combined with its good histocompatibility and facile preparation technique, this pH-responsive APP-Fe NCs with regulation on TME may hold potential for cascade amplification on the combinative immunotherapy of lymphoma in the clinic.","2023-06-13","2024-07-04 23:01:00","2024-07-07 21:55:08","2024-07-04 23:00:04","10925-10937","","11","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/R2RCJM4Y/Nie et al. - 2023 - Tumor Microenvironment Mediated Spermidine-Metal-I.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present the significance of chiral surface domains of these self-assemblies in transferring chirality to achiral chromophores. These aspects are probed using l- and d-isomers of alkyl alanine amphiphiles which self-assemble in water as nanofibers, possessing a negative surface charge. When bound on these nanofibers, positively charged cyanine dyes (CY524 and CY600), each having two quinoline rings bridged by conjugated double bonds, show contrasting chiroptical features. Interestingly, CY600 displays a bisignated circular dichroic (CD) signal with mirror-image symmetry, while CY524 is CD silent. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the model cylindrical micelles (CM) derived from the two isomers exhibit surface chirality and the chromophores are buried as monomers in mirror-imaged pockets on their surfaces. The monomeric nature of template-bound chromophores and their binding reversibility are established by concentration- and temperature-dependent spectroscopies and calorimetry. On the CM, CY524 displays two equally populated conformers with opposite sense, whereas CY600 is present as two pairs of twisted conformers in each of which one is in excess, due to differences in weak dye–amphiphile hydrogen bonding interactions. Infrared and NMR spectroscopies support these findings. Reduction of electronic conjugation caused by the twist establishes the two quinoline rings as independent entities. On-resonance coupling between the transition dipoles of these units generates bisignated CD signals with mirror-image symmetry.

Due to the combination of enhanced ICD and TAAs presentation, the maturation of DCs and the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the ITME were stimulated.

The GENPs can accumulate in tumors through homotypic targeting and effectively deliver retinoic acid, inducing disorganization of the Golgi apparatus and a sequence of intracellular events including alteration of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi trafficking and subsequent ER stress, which finally disrupts the PD-L1 production and the release of exosomes. Furthermore, GENPs could mimic exosomes to access draining lymph nodes. The membrane antigen of PD-l1–/– exosome on GENPs can activate T cells through a vaccine-like effect, strongly promoting systemic immune responses.

However, the tumor can develop an immunosuppressive microenvironment to affect the ICD activation for the purpose of immune escape. Herein, a paraptosis inducer (CMN) is constructed to amplify the ICD effect for efficient immunotherapy by inhibiting the activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Initially, CMN is prepared by the assembly of copper ions (Cu2+), morusin (MR), and IDO inhibitor (NLG919) through noncovalent interactions. Without the need for extra drug carriers, CMN possesses very high drug contents and exhibits a favorable GSH responsiveness for disassembly. Subsequently, the released MR can trigger paraptosis to cause extensive vacuolization of ER and mitochondria, contributing to activating ICD for immunotherapy. Moreover, NLG919 would inhibit IDO to remodel the tumor microenvironment and promote the activation of cytotoxic T cells, leading to an intensive antitumor immunity. Abundant in vivo studies indicate that CMN is superior in suppressing the proliferations of not only primary tumor but also metastatic and rechallenged tumors.

We used liposomes decorated with amphiphilic boronic acids that commonly serve as synthetic saccharide receptors and generated three lateral modes of receptor presentation─random distribution, nanoclustering, and receptor crowding─and studied their interaction with saccharides. In comparison to liposomes with randomly dispersed receptors, surface-imprinted liposomes resulted in more than a 5-fold increase in avidity. Quantifying the binding affinity and cooperativity proved that the boost was mediated by the formation of the nanoclusters rather than a local increase in the receptor concentration. In contrast, receptor crowding, despite the presence of increased local receptor concentrations, prevented multivalent oligosaccharide binding due to steric effects. The findings demonstrate the significance of nanometric aspects of receptor presentation and generation of multivalent ligands including artificial lectins for the sensitive and specific detection of glycans.","2023-06-13","2024-07-04 23:01:00","2024-07-06 06:57:04","2024-07-04 23:00:16","10327-10336","","11","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/M4BT89S8/Tabaei et al. - 2023 - Recapitulating the Lateral Organization of Membran.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, the modulation of intratumoral pathogens may provide a target for cancer therapy and metastasis inhibition. Herein, we propose an intratumoral F. nucleatum-modulating strategy for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of CRC and inhibiting lung metastasis by designing an antibacterial nanoplatform (Au@BSA-CuPpIX), which produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) under ultrasound and exhibited strong antibacterial activity. Importantly, Au@BSA-CuPpIX reduced the levels of apoptosis-inhibiting proteins by inhibiting intratumoral F. nucleatum, thereby enhancing ROS-induced apoptosis. In vivo results demonstrated that Au@BSA-CuPpIX effectively eliminated F. nucleatum to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) for orthotopic CRC and inhibit lung metastasis. Notably, entrapped gold nanoparticles reduced the phototoxicity of metalloporphyrin accumulated in the skin during tumor treatment, preventing severe inflammation and damage to the skin.

Graphene oxides (GOs) are considered a solid candidate for the RED membrane because the laminated GO nanochannels with charged functional groups provide an excellent ionic selectivity and conductivity. Yet, a high internal resistance and poor stability in aqueous solutions limit the RED performance. Here, we develop a RED membrane that concurrently achieves high ion permeability and stable operation based on epoxy-confined GO nanochannels with asymmetric structures. The membrane is fabricated by reacting epoxy-wrapped GO membranes with ethylene diamine via vapor diffusion, overcoming the swelling properties in aqueous solutions. More importantly, the resultant membrane exhibits asymmetric GO nanochannels in terms of both channel geometry and electrostatic surface charges, leading to the rectified ion transport behavior. The demonstrated GO membrane exhibits the RED performance up to 5.32 W·m–2 with >40% energy conversion efficiency across a 50-fold salinity gradient and 20.3 W·m–2 across a 500-fold salinity gradient. Planck–Nernst continuum models coupled to molecular dynamics simulations rationalize the improved RED performance in terms of the asymmetric ionic concentration gradient within the GO nanochannel and the ionic resistance. The multiscale model also provides the design guidelines for ionic diode-type membranes configuring the optimum surface charge density and ionic diffusivity for efficient osmotic energy harvesting.

Inspired by the potency of cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in initiating anticancer immunity by activating the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway, we herein report the concise synthesis of a cGAS-STING agonist through dsDNA-templated biomineralization growth of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) microparticles. The yielded DNA@CaCO3 can activate the intracellular cGAS-STING pathway of dendritic cells (DCs) by promoting endosomal escape of dsDNA, triggering their maturation and activation as a potent immune stimulator. Upon intratumoral injection, DNA@CaCO3 can reverse the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by simultaneously provoking innate and adaptive antitumor immunity, thereby effectively suppressing the growth of murine CT26 and B16–F10 tumors in mice. Furthermore, via CaCO3-based biomineralization of complete tumor lysates, we constructed a personalized autologous cancer vaccine with intrinsic cGAS-STING activation capacity that could provoke tumor-specific immune responses to not only delay the growth of challenged tumors but also synergize with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy to suppress postsurgical tumor recurrence.

The reversal of HMGA1-mediated immunosuppression could enhance immunogenic tumor cell death-induced immune responses. A ferrimagnetic vortex-domain iron oxide (FVIO) nanoring-based nanovehicle was developed, which is capable of efficiently mediating an alternating magnetic field for immunogenic tumor cell death induction, while concurrently delivering HMGA1 small interfering (si)RNA (siHMGA1) to the cytoplasm of hepatocellular carcinoma Hepa 1–6 cells for HMGA1 pathway interference.

Here, we report the design and implementation of adaptive two-way signaling with lipid-vesicle-based synthetic cells. The first layer of self-regulation derives from coupling the temporal dynamics of the signal, H2O2, production in the sender to adhesions between sender and receiver cells. This way the receiver stays within the signaling range for the duration sender produces the signal and detaches once the signal fades. Specifically, H2O2 acts as both a forward signal and a regulator of the adhesions by activating photoswitchable proteins at the surface for the duration of the chemiluminescence. The second layer of self-regulation arises when the adhesions render the receiver permeable and trigger the release of a backward signal, resulting in bidirectional exchange.

However, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment always hinders the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. In this report, we present polymeric metal–organic framework (PMOF) nanoparticles (NPs) for the combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and enhanced STING activation to improve the immunotherapeutic efficacy. The PMOF NPs with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) shells were obtained via coordination between the block copolymer ligand PEG-b-PABDA consisting of 1,4-bezenedicarboxylic acid-bearing polyacrylamide (PABDA), meso-tetra(carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP), thioketal diacetic acid, and zirconyl chloride. Subsequently, the STING agonist SR-717 was loaded into the porous structure of PMOF to obtain SR@PMOF NPs which show excellent stability under the physiological conditions. After intravenous injection and tumor accumulation, light irradiation on the tumor sites results in efficient singlet oxygen (1O2) production from TCPP and cellular apoptosis to release fragmented DNA and tumor-associated antigens. Simultaneously, thioketal bonds can be broken by 1O2 to destroy the PMOF structure and rapidly release SR717. SR-717 and PDT synergistically enhance the antitumor immunity via combination photodynamic-immunotherapy due to reversal of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhanced endogenous STING activation, which can suppress the growth of the primary and distant tumors efficiently. The oxidation-responsive SR@PMOF NPs represent a promising delivery system of STING agonists and efficient PDT NPs for simultaneous suppression of the primary and metastatic tumors via the rational combination of PDT and enhanced STING activation.","2023-05-23","2024-07-04 23:01:00","2024-07-07 05:31:56","2024-07-04 23:00:47","9374-9387","","10","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/NBU2NA5B/Zhou et al. - 2023 - Oxidation-Responsive PolyMOF Nanoparticles for Com.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The blockade of CD47 alone is insufficient to stimulate tumor cell phagocytosis in solid tumors due to the lack of “eat me” signals. Herein, a degradable mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) is reported to simultaneously deliver anti-CD47 antibodies (aCD47) and doxorubicin (DOX) for cancer chemo-immunotherapy.

Inspired by the biotin–avidin interaction, we developed a simple yet versatile method for the immobilization of MSC-derived EXs (MSC-EXs) into hydrogels and achieved sustained release for regenerative purposes. First, biotin-modified gelatin methacryloyl (Bio-GelMA) was fabricated by grafting NHS-PEG12-biotin onto the amino groups of GelMA.

Thereafter, Bio-EXs were immobilized in Bio-GelMA via streptavidin to generate Bio-GelMA@Bio-EX hydrogels. An in vitro analysis demonstrated that Bio-EXs could be taken up by macrophages and exerted immunomodulatory effects similar to those of MSC-EXs, and Bio-GelMA@Bio-EX hydrogels provided sustained release of MSC-EXs for 7 days. After subcutaneous transplantation, a more constant retention of MSC-EXs in Bio-GelMA@Bio-EX hydrogels was observed for up to 28 days.

We have developed transferrin-conjugated, pH-responsive nanomicelles for the entrapment of MCC950 drug. These nanomicelles specifically bind to the transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) expressed on the cells of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and thus help the cargo to cross the BBB. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of nanomicelles was assessed using in vitro, in ovo, and in vivo models of I/R injury. Nanomicelles were injected into the common carotid artery (CCA) of a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model to achieve maximum accretion of nanomicelles into the brain as blood flows toward the brain in the CCA. The current study reveals that the treatment with nanomicelles significantly alleviates the levels of NLRP3 inflammasome biomarkers which were found to be increased in oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated SH-SY5Y cells, the I/R-damaged right vitelline artery (RVA) of chick embryos, and the MCAO rat model.

This work presents a platform architecture that integrates apoptosis induction, drug loading, and functionalized proteome regulation, followed by targeting modification, enabling the creation of an apoptotic vesicle delivery system to treat ischemic stroke. Briefly, α-mangostin (α-M) was utilized to induce mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) apoptosis while being loaded onto MSC-derived ApoVs as an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agent for cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Matrix metalloproteinase activatable cell-penetrating peptide (MAP), a microenvironment-responsive targeting peptide, was modified on the surface of ApoVs to obtain the MAP-functionalized α-M-loaded ApoVs. Such engineered ApoVs targeted the injured ischemic brain after systemic injection and achieved an enhanced neuroprotective activity due to the synergistic effect of ApoVs and α-M. The internal protein payloads of ApoVs, upon α-M activation, were found engaged in regulating immunological response, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation, all of which contributed to the therapeutic effects of ApoVs.

However, current theranostic strategies suffer from low imaging sensitivity for visualization and an inability to target the diseased tissue site with high specificity, thus hindering their translation to the clinic. In this study, we have developed a tumor microenvironment-responsive hybrid theranostic agent by grafting water-soluble, low-fouling fluoropolymers to pH-responsive zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) nanoparticles by surface-initiated RAFT polymerization. The conjugation of the fluoropolymers to ZIF-8 nanoparticles not only allows sensitive in vivo visualization of the nanoparticles by 19F MRI but also significantly prolongs their circulation time in the bloodstream, resulting in improved delivery efficiency to tumor tissue. The ZIF-8-fluoropolymer nanoparticles can respond to the acidic tumor microenvironment, leading to progressive degradation of the nanoparticles and release of zinc ions as well as encapsulated anticancer drugs. The zinc ions released from the ZIF-8 can further coordinate to the fluoropolymers to switch the hydrophilicity and reverse the surface charge of the nanoparticles. This transition in hydrophilicity and surface charge of the polymeric coating can reduce the “stealth-like” nature of the agent and enhance specific uptake by cancer cells. Hence, these hybrid nanoparticles represent intelligent theranostics with highly sensitive imaging capability, significantly prolonged blood circulation time, greatly improved accumulation within the tumor tissue, and enhanced anticancer therapeutic efficiency.","2023-05-09","2024-07-04 23:03:13","2024-07-06 01:03:49","2024-07-04 23:01:43","8483-8498","","9","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/3K47JA3T/Wang et al. - 2023 - Fluoropolymer-MOF Hybrids with Switchable Hydrophi.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A significant challenge in managing lung cancer is the accurate diagnosis of cancerous lesions owing to the lack of sensitive and specific biomarkers. The current procedure necessitates an invasive tissue biopsy for diagnosis and molecular subtyping, which presents patients with risk, morbidity, anxiety, and high false-positive rates. The high-risk diagnostic approach has highlighted the need to search for a reliable, low-risk noninvasive diagnostic approach to capture lung cancer heterogeneity precisely. The immune interaction profile of lung cancer is driven by immune cells’ distinctive, precise interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Here, we hypothesize that immune cells, particularly T cells, can be used for accurate lung cancer diagnosis by exploiting the distinctive immune–tumor interaction by detecting the immune-diagnostic signature. We have developed an ultrasensitive T-sense nanosensor to probe these specific diagnostic signatures using the physical synthesis process of multiphoton ionization. Our research employed predictive in vitro models of lung cancers, cancer-associated T cells (PCAT, MCAT) and CSC-associated T cells (PCSCAT, MCSCAT), from primary and metastatic lung cancer patients to reveal the immune-diagnostic signature and uncover the molecular, functional, and phenotypic separation between patient-derived T cells (PDT) and healthy samples. We demonstrated this by adopting a machine learning model trained with SERS data obtained using cocultured T cells with preclinical models (CAT, CSCAT) of primary (H69AR) and metastatic lung cancer (H1915). Interrogating these distinct signatures with PDT captured the complexity and diversity of the tumor-associated T cell signature across the patient population, exposing the clinical feasibility of immune diagnosis in an independent cohort of patient samples. Thus, our predictive approach using T cells from the patient peripheral blood showed a highly accurate diagnosis with a specificity and sensitivity of 94.1% and 100%, respectively, for primary lung cancer and 97.9% and 94.4% for metastatic lung cancer. Our results prove that the immune-diagnostic signature developed in this study could be used as a clinical technology for cancer diagnosis and determine the course of clinical management with T cells.","2023-05-09","2024-07-04 23:03:13","2024-07-06 01:11:11","2024-07-04 23:01:45","8026-8040","","9","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/JQDCWZNI/Ganesh et al. - 2023 - Mapping Immune–Tumor Bidirectional Dialogue Using .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Interestingly, the conjugation of TPE luminogen promotes liquid–liquid phase separation of the peptide repeats, and the minimum coacervation concentration (MCC) of TPE-(RRASL)n is decreased by an order of magnitude, compared to that of the untagged, TPE-free counterparts. Moreover, the luminescence of TPE-(RRASL)n is enhanced by up to 700-fold with increasing RNA concentration, which is attributed to the constricted rotation of the TPE moiety as a result of peptide/RNA coacervates within the droplet phase. Besides, at concentrations above MCC, TPE-(RRASL)n can efficiently penetrate through human gallbladder carcinoma cells (SGC-996), translocate into the cell nucleus, and colocalize with intracellular RNA.

Through E1 elimination, precursor conversion leads to the formation of small amorphous particles (less than 2 nm in diameter). Over the course of the reaction, the total particle concentration decreases while the concentration of nanocrystals stays constant after a sudden increase (nucleation). Kinetic modeling suggests that amorphous particles nucleate into nanocrystals through a second order process and they are also the source of nanocrystal growth. There is no evidence for a soluble monomer. The nonclassical nucleation is related to a precursor decomposition rate that is an order of magnitude higher than the observed crystallization rate. Using different zirconium precursors (e.g., ZrBr4 or Zr(OtBu)4), we can tune the precursor decomposition rate and thus control the nanocrystal size.

Transcriptomic study further offers solid evidence for deeply understanding the in vivo activity of MABac-based vaccine, which more effectively motivates multiple cytosolic immune pathways (such as NOD-like receptors and STING) and induces pleiotropic immune responses in comparison with Bac. Harnessing the special functions caused by morphology tuning, the MABac-based adjuvant/carrier significantly improves the immunogenicity and delivery profile of cancer antigens in vivo, thus boosting cancer-specific immunity against the melanoma challenge. This study validates the feasibility of tuning bacterial morphology to improve their biological effects, establishing a facile engineering strategy that upgrades bacterial properties and functions without complex procedures like gene editing.","2023-05-09","2024-07-04 23:03:13","2024-07-06 01:08:43","2024-07-04 23:01:49","8815-8828","","9","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/Z7CB662M/Li et al. - 2023 - Tuning Bacterial Morphology to Enhance Anticancer .pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Opposing effects on the curvature of the membrane were observed upon the addition of phospholipids and cholesterol. Furthermore, the coronavirus fusion peptide significantly increased the negative curvature of the biomimetic membrane with cholesterol. We show that the viral fusion peptide can undergo structural changes leading to the formation of hydrophobic α-helices that insert into the lipid bilayer. This is of high importance, as a fusion peptide that induces increased negative curvature as shown by the formation of inverse hexagonal phases allows for greater contact area between two membranes, which is required for viral fusion to occur. The cytotoxicity assay showed that the toxicity toward HeLa cells was dramatically decreased when the cholesterol or peptide level in the nanoparticles increased. This suggests that the addition of cholesterol can improve the biocompatibility of the cubic phase nanoparticles, making them safer for use in biomedical applications.

Here, we report a bias-free high-throughput and high-yield continuous isoelectric fractionation nanocarrier fractionation technique based on their distinct isoelectric points. This nanocarrier fractionation platform is enabled by a robust and tunable linear pH profile provided by water-splitting at a bipolar membrane and stabilized by flow without ampholytes.

The platform is automated with a machine learning procedure to allow recalibration for different physiological fluids and nanocarriers.

Explicitly, the theoretical simulations and experimental results have solidly validated that the Te-0.6 microneedle grown along the [110] orientation possesses a stronger asymmetric distribution of Te atoms array causing the enhanced dipole moment and in-plane polarization, which boosts a higher transfer and separation efficiency of the electron and hole pairs and a higher piezoelectric potential under the same stress. Additionally, the orientated atomic array along the [110] has p antibonding states with a higher energy level, resulting in a higher CB potential and a broadened band gap. Meanwhile, it also has a much lower barrier toward the valid adsorption of H2O and O2 molecules over other orientations, effectively conducive to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for the efficient piezo-catalytic sterilization.

In this study, we introduced a phosphate group as a cancer-specific biomarker of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on a PS with the features of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) for cancer cell imaging and therapy. In cancer cells with high ALP expression, the phosphate group on the AIE probe is selectively hydrolyzed by ALP. Consequently, the hydrophobic probe residue is aggregated in aqueous media and gives a “turn on” fluorescent response. Moreover, fluorescence-guided PDT was realized by the aggregates of probe residue with strong ROS generation efficiency under white light irradiation.

Short single-stranded DNA/RNA nucleotides forming a three-dimensional structure, called aptamers, have received increasing attention as BBB shuttles for efficient brain drug delivery owing to their practical advantages over Trojan horse antibodies or peptides. Aptamers are typically obtained by combinatorial chemical technology, termed Systemic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential Enrichment (SELEX), against purified targets, living cells, or animal models. However, identifying reliable BBB-penetrating aptamers that perform efficiently under human physiological conditions has been challenging because of the poor physiological relevance in the conventional SELEX process. Here, we report a human BBB shuttle aptamer (hBS) identified using a human microphysiological system (MPS)-based SELEX (MPS-SELEX) method. A two-channel MPS lined with human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) interfaced with astrocytes and pericytes, recapitulating high-level barrier function of in vivo BBB, was exploited as a screening platform. The MPS-SELEX procedure enabled robust function-based screening of the hBS candidates, which was not achievable in traditional in vitro BBB models. The identified aptamer (hBS01) through five-round of MPS-SELEX exhibited high capability to transport protein cargoes across the human BBB via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and enhanced uptake efficiency in BMECs and brain cells. The enhanced targeting specificity of hBS01 was further validated both in vitro and in vivo, confirming its powerful brain accumulation efficiency. These findings demonstrate that MPS-SELEX has potential in the discovery of aptamers with high target specificity that can be widely utilized to boost the development of drug delivery strategies.","2023-05-09","2024-07-04 23:03:13","2024-07-06 01:12:14","2024-07-04 23:01:57","8153-8166","","9","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/GCBUPMUQ/Choi et al. - 2023 - Aptamer Nanoconstructs Crossing Human Blood–Brain .pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, we introduce nattokinase (NKase), a thrombolytic healthcare drug, to comprehensively regulate the TPME for versatile enhancement of various therapy modalities. Intratumoral injection of NKase not only degrades the major ECM component fibronectin but also inhibits cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in generating fibrosis, resulting in decreased tumor stiffness, enhanced perfusion, and hypoxia alleviation. The NKase-mediated regulation of the TPME significantly promotes the tumoral accumulation of therapeutic agents, leading to efficient chemotherapy without inducing side effects. Additionally, the enhancement of tumor radiotherapy based on radiosensitizers was also achieved by the pretreatment of intratumorally injected NKase, which could be ascribed to the elevated oxygen saturation level in NKase-treated tumors. Moreover, a xenografted human breast MDB-MA-231 tumor model is established to evaluate the influence of NKase on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, illustrating that the pretreatment of NKase could boost the infiltration of CAR-T cells into tumors and thus be a benefit for tumor inhibition.

In this study, a sonosensitizer based on a Hf-based metal–organic framework (UIO-66) and Au nanoparticles (NPs) was produced. Under US irradiation, UIO-66 can generate a built-in electric field inside the materials, which promotes electron–hole separation and produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). The introduction of Au NPs facilitated the electron transfer, which inhibited the recombination of the electron–hole pairs and improved the piezoelectric properties of UIO-66. The value of the piezoelectric constant (d33) increased from 71 to 122 pmV–1 after the deposition of Au NPs. In addition, the intrinsic catalase and peroxidase activities of the Au NPs were increased 2-fold after the stimulation from the built-in electric field induced through US exposure.

Using expansion microscopy (ExM), we found striking changes in HS nanostructure occur as human pluripotent stem (hPS) cells differentiate, and these changes correlate with growth factor signaling. Our imaging studies show that undifferentiated hPS cells are densely coated with HS displayed as hair-like protrusions. This ultrastructure can recruit fibroblast growth factor for signaling. When the hPS cells differentiate into the ectoderm lineage, HS is localized into dispersed puncta. This striking change in HS distribution coincides with a decrease in fibroblast growth factor binding to neural cells. While developmental variations in HS sequence were thought to be the primary driver of alterations in HS-mediated growth factor signaling, our high-resolution images indicate a role for the HS nanostructure.

However, this study showed that silk protein molecules existed in the form of a fractal network structure in aqueous solution, rather than as a single chain. This type of network was relatively rigid with low fractal dimension. Finite element analysis revealed that this network structure significantly helped in the stable storage of SF prior to the spinning process and in the rapid formation of a β-sheeted nanocrystalline and nematic texture during spinning. Further, the strong but brittle mechanical properties of Bombyx mori silk could also be well-explained through the fractal network model of silk fibroin. The strength was mainly derived from the dual network structure, consisting of nodes and β-sheet cross-links, whereas the brittleness could be attributed to the rigidity of the SF chains between these nodes and cross-links. In summary, this study presents insights from network topology for understanding the spinning process of natural silk and the structure–property relationship in silk materials.","2023-04-25","2024-07-04 23:03:13","2024-07-06 01:14:08","2024-07-04 23:02:08","7662-7673","","8","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/QLGGC8SX/Yang et al. - 2023 - The Fractal Network Structure of Silk Fibroin Mole.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of polar aprotic solvent (like dimethyl sulfoxide) for the formation of GO LLC structures would be interesting, because it would allow incorporating additives, like photoinitiators or cross-linkers, or blending with polymers that are insoluble in water, which hence would expand its scope. The well-balanced electrostatic interaction between DMSO and GO can promote and stabilize the GO nanosheets’ alignment even at lower concentrations. With this in mind, herein we report mechanically robust, chlorine-tolerant, self-assembled nanostructured GO membranes for precise molecular sieving. Small-angle X-ray scattering and polarized optical microscopy confirmed the alignment of the modified GO nanosheets in polar aprotic solvent, and the LLC structure was effectively preserved even after cross-linking under UV light. We found that the modified GO membranes exhibited considerably improved salt rejection for monovalent ions (99%) and water flux (120 LMH) as compared to the shear-aligned GO membrane, which is well supported by forward osmosis simulation studies. Additionally, our simulation studies indicated that water molecules traveled a longer path while permeating through the GO membrane compared to the GO LLC membrane. Consequently, salt ions permeate slowly across the GO LLC membrane, yielding higher salt rejection than the GO membrane. This begins to suggest strong electrostatic repulsion with the salt ions, causing higher salt rejection in the GO LLC membrane. We foresee that the ordered cross-linked GO sheets contributed to excellent mechanical stability under a high-pressure, cross-flow, chlorine environment. Overall, these membranes are easily scalable, exhibit good mechanical stability, and represent a breakthrough for the potential use of polymerized GO LLC membranes in practical water remediation applications.","2023-04-25","2024-07-04 23:03:13","2024-07-06 01:15:39","2024-07-04 23:02:10","7272-7284","","8","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/3CM73VUF/Pathan et al. - 2023 - Fundamental Understanding of Ultrathin, Highly Sta.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The LA-α-CD-in-TpPa-1 membrane shows a high H2 permeance (∼3000 GPU) together with an enhanced selectivity (>30) of H2 over CO2 and CH4 due to the formation of fast and selective H2-transport pathways. The overall performance for H2/CO2 and H2/CH4 separation transcends the Robeson upper bounds and ranks among the most powerful H2-selective membranes. The versatility of this strategy is demonstrated by synthesizing different types of LA-α-CD-in-COF membranes.","2023-04-25","2024-07-04 23:03:13","2024-07-06 01:20:29","2024-07-04 23:02:15","7584-7594","","8","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/VNSIMSTP/Fan et al. - 2023 - Pore-in-Pore Engineering in a Covalent Organic Fra.pdf; /Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/352RPV6S/Fan et al. - 2023 - Pore-in-Pore Engineering in a Covalent Organic Fra.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By localizing treatment to organs susceptible to Dox-mediated toxicity, BPN-KP acts as a decoy that prevents the drug from intercalating into the nuclei of healthy cells. This results in significantly increased tolerance to Dox, thereby enabling the delivery of high drug doses into tumor tissue without detectable toxicity. By lessening the leukodepletive effects normally associated with chemotherapy, dramatic immune activation within the tumor microenvironment was also observed after treatment. In three different murine tumor models, high-dose Dox with BPN-KP pretreatment resulted in significantly prolonged survival, particularly when combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

Here, a bioinspired, staged photothermal effect-reinforced multifunctional scaffold was fabricated for bone repair. Uniaxially aligned electrospun polycaprolactone nanofibers were doped with black phosphorus nanosheets (BP NSs) to endow the scaffold with excellent near-infrared (NIR) responsive capability.

Under NIR irradiation, photothermal-mediated up-regulation of heat shock proteins and accelerated biodegradation of BP NSs could promote the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and biomineralization.

Here, we explore how DNA sequence design can be used to deliberately separate nucleation and growth in a given crystallization process. Specifically, two batches of complementary particles are created with one batch exhibiting perfectly complementary base pairs while the other has a strategically introduced mismatch. This design enables the weaker binding “growth” particles to participate in heterogeneous growth on the nucleates formed from the stronger binding “seed” particles, effectively eliminating secondary nucleation pathways. By eliminating secondary nucleation events, this approach improves crystal uniformity, as measured by polydispersity (from PDI = 0.201 to 0.091). By using this approach with two different particle cores (gold and silver), we show how core–shell colloidal crystals can be synthesized in a one-pot fashion.

Early diagnosis is critical as there is only a narrow time window during which therapeutic intervention can reverse disease progression. Computed tomography (CT) has been considered for cartilage imaging as a tool for early OA diagnosis by introducing radio-opaque contrast agents like ioxaglate (IOX) into the joint. IOX, however, is anionic and thus repelled by negatively charged cartilage glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that hinders its intra-tissue penetration and partitioning, resulting in poor CT attenuation. This is further complicated by its short intra-tissue residence time owing to rapid clearance from joints, which necessitates high doses causing toxicity concerns. Here we engineer optimally charged cationic contrast agents based on cartilage negative fixed charge density by conjugating cartilage targeting a cationic peptide carrier (CPC) and multi-arm avidin nanoconstruct (mAv) to IOX, such that they can penetrate through the full thickness of cartilage within 6 h using electrostatic interactions and elicit similar CT signal with about 40× lower dose compared to anionic IOX. Their partitioning and distribution correlate strongly with spatial GAG distribution within healthy and early- to late-stage arthritic bovine cartilage tissues at 50–100× lower doses than other cationic contrast agents used in the current literature. The use of contrast agents at low concentrations also allowed for delineation of cartilage from subchondral bone as well as other soft tissues in rat tibial joints. These contrast agents are safe to use at current doses, making CT a viable imaging modality for early detection of OA and staging of its severity.","2023-04-11","2024-07-04 23:03:13","2024-07-06 01:23:50","2024-07-04 23:02:35","6649-6663","","7","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/5GCIDRWT/Zhang et al. - 2023 - Cationic Carrier Mediated Delivery of Anionic Cont.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the spatial organization of antigen–antibody–receptor complexes at the nanometer scale and the structural constraints involved in the initial events at the cell surface are not yet fully understood. For example, it is unclear what influence the affinity and nanoscale distance between the binding partners involved have on the activation of mast cells to degranulate inflammatory mediators from storage granules. We report the use of DNA origami nanostructures (DON) functionalized with different arrangements of the haptenic 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) ligand to generate multivalent artificial antigens with full control over valency and nanoscale ligand architecture. To investigate the spatial requirements for mast cell activation, the DNP–DON complexes were initially used in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis to study the binding kinetics of isolated IgE under physiological conditions. The most stable binding was observed in a narrow window of approximately 16 nm spacing between haptens. In contrast, affinity studies with FcεRI-linked IgE antibodies on the surface of rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) indicated virtually no distance-dependent variations in the binding of the differently structured DNP–DON complexes but suggested a supramolecular oligovalent nature of the interaction. Finally, the use of DNP–DON complexes for mast cell activation revealed that antigen-directed tight assembly of antibody-receptor complexes is the critical factor for triggering degranulation, even more critical than ligand valence. Our study emphasizes the significance of DNA nanostructures for the study of fundamental biological processes.","2023-04-11","2024-07-04 23:03:13","2024-07-06 01:25:37","2024-07-04 23:02:36","6719-6730","","7","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/3NIIWSX5/Schneider et al. - 2023 - Hapten-Decorated DNA Nanostructures Decipher the A.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under the guidance of CsPLT, it selectively accumulated in the thrombus site and quickly released the therapeutic payloads in response to the high ROS. tPA subsequently exhibited localized thrombolytic activity to suppress the expansion of thrombus, while ASA assisted in the inactivation of reactive astrogliosis, microglial/macrophage, and obstruction of neutrophil infiltration. This cryo-shocked platelet-hitchhiking tPA/ASA delivery system not only improves the thrombus-targeting efficiency of the two drugs for highly localized thrombolytic effects and anti-inflammation actions and platelets inactivation but also provides insights to the development of targeted drug delivery systems for thromboembolic disease treatment.","2023-04-11","2024-07-04 23:03:13","2024-07-06 01:25:59","2024-07-04 23:02:42","6519-6533","","7","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/YIGCUTH7/Quan et al. - 2023 - Cryo-Shocked Platelet Coupled with ROS-Responsive .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We herein report an abiotic synthetic antibody inhibitor as a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic agent. The inhibitor, Aphe-NP14, was selected from a synthetic hydrogel polymer nanoparticle library created by incorporating monomers with functionalities complementary to key residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain (RBD) involved in human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding. It has high capacity, fast adsorption kinetics, strong affinity, and broad specificity in biologically relevant conditions to both the wild type and the current variants of concern, including Beta, Delta, and Omicron spike RBD. The Aphe-NP14 uptake of spike RBD results in strong blockage of spike RBD–ACE2 interaction and thus potent neutralization efficacy against these escaping spike protein variant pseudotyped viruses. It also inhibits live SARS-CoV-2 virus recognition, entry, replication, and infection in vitro and in vivo. The Aphe-NP14 intranasal administration is found to be safe due to its low in vitro and in vivo toxicity.

To address these issues, herein, a nanosystem composed of Janus Au/mesoporous silica core/shell nanoparticles (Janus NPs) is designed for effective therapeutic and real-time tracing of MSCs in MSC-based IPF therapy. The Janus NPs consist of a Au core and a pirfenidone (PFD)-loaded mesoporous silica shell asymmetrically decorated with two targeting moieties: one is reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive thioketal grafted methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG-TK), and the other is 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE). The asymmetric decoration on each side of the particle allows long-term anchoring of the Janus NPs on the cell membrane to facilitate the responsive release of PFD in the ROS environment of the fibrotic lung, thereby enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of the transplanted MSCs by improving the microenvironment. Following drug release, the Janus NPs quickly enter into MSCs, achieving long-term computed tomography (CT) imaging tracing of MSCs in IPF model mice for an in-depth comprehension of the cell therapy mechanism.

The colloids (NTc) composed of amino-modified poly-β-cyclodextrin and tannic acid are formed based on the balance of host–guest interaction-driven attraction and electrostatic repulsion between colloids. Negatively charged probiotics electrostatically attract positively charged NTc to break the balance and induce further assembly surrounding the probiotics.

Moreover, owing to the dynamically noncovalent and self-adaptive nature of host–guest interactions, NTc shells support the proliferation of the encapsulated EcN comparable with that of the naked EcN.

However, it is not known how such nanoparticles interact with bacteria at nanoscale. In the present work, we evaluated the interaction of multi-principal elemental alloy (FeNiCu) nanoparticles with Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria using the in situ graphene liquid cell (GLC) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) approach. The imaging revealed the details of bacteria wall damage in the vicinity of nanoparticles. The chemical mappings of S, P, O, N, C, and Cl elements confirmed the cytoplasmic leakage of the bacteria. Our results show that there is selective release of metal ions from the nanoparticles. The release of copper ions was much higher than that for nickel while the iron release was the lowest. In addition, the binding affinity of bacterial cell membrane protein functional groups with Cu, Ni, and Fe cations is found to be the driving force behind the selective metal cations’ release from the multi-principal element nanoparticles. The protein functional groups driven dissolution of multielement nanoparticles was evaluated using the density functional theory (DFT) computational method, which confirmed that the energy required to remove Cu atoms from the nanoparticle surface was the least in comparison with those for Ni and Fe atoms.

Herein, a dual-functional medication is developed to simultaneously protect cartilage and achieve subchondral bone repair. Black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs), with a strong reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging capability and high biocompatibility, also present a notable promoting effect in osteogenesis. BPNSs efficiently eliminate the intracellular ROS and, thus, protect the inherent homeostasis between cartilage matrix anabolism and catabolism.

Additional in vivo assessments solidly confirm that BPNSs inhibit cartilage degradation and prevent OA progression. Meanwhile, histological evaluation and microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) scanning analysis verify the satisfying disease-modifying effects of BPNSs on OA. Additionally, the excellent biocompatibility of BPNSs enables them as a competitive candidate for OA treatment.

To remodel tumor immunogenicity, herein, a dual-activatable binary CRISPR nanomedicine (DBCN) that can efficiently deliver a CRISPR system into tumor tissues and specifically control its activation is reported. This DBCN is made of a thioketal-cross-linked polyplex core and an acid-detachable polymer shell, which can maintain stability during blood circulation, while detaching a polymer shell to facilitate the cellular internalization of the CRISPR system after entering tumor tissues and ultimately activating gene editing under exogenous laser irradiation, thereby maximizing the therapeutic benefits and reducing potential safety concerns. With the collaborative application of multiple CRISPR systems, DBCN efficiently corrects both dysregulation of MHC-1 and PD-L1 expression in tumors, thus initiating robust T cell-dependent antitumor immune responses to inhibit malignant tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence.

The major difference with conventional epitaxy is the weaker interaction between the epi-layer and the epi-substrates. Indeed, research on Q-vdW epitaxial growth of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) has been intense, with oriented growth of atomically thin semiconductors on sapphire being one of the most studied systems. Nonetheless, there are some striking and not yet understood differences in the literature regarding the orientation registry between the epi-layers and epi-substrate and the interface chemistry. Here we study the growth of WS2 via a sequential exposure of the metal and the chalcogen precursors in a metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) system, introducing a metal-seeding step prior to the growth. The ability to control the delivery of the precursor made it possible to study the formation of a continuous and apparently ordered WO3 mono- or few-layer at the surface of a c-plane sapphire.

Ferroptosis therapy has recently been raised as a promising strategy for lung cancer treatment by boosting the reactive species (ROS) production and lipid peroxidation (LPO) accumulation intracellularly. However, the insufficient intracellular ROS level and the unsatisfactory drug accumulation in lung cancer lesions hamper the efficacy of ferroptosis therapy. Here, an inhalable biomineralized liposome LDM co-loaded with dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and pH-responsive calcium phosphate (CaP) was constructed as a ferroptosis nanoinducer for achieving Ca2+-burst-centered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress enhanced lung cancer ferroptosis therapy. Equipped with excellent nebulization properties, about 6.80-fold higher lung lesions drug accumulation than intravenous injection made the proposed inhalable LDM an ideal nanoplatform for lung cancer treatment. The Fenton-like reaction mediated by DHA with peroxide bridge structure could contribute to intracellular ROS production and induce ferroptosis. Assisted by DHA-mediated sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) inhibition, the initial Ca2+ burst caused by CaP shell degradation triggered the Ca2+-mediated intense ER stress and subsequently induced mitochondria dysfunction to further boost ROS accumulation, which strengthens ferroptosis. The second Ca2+ burst occurred as a result of Ca2+ influx through ferroptotic pores on cell membranes, thus sequentially constructing the lethal “Ca2+ burst-ER stress-ferroptosis” cycle. Consequently, the Ca2+-burst-centered ER stress enhanced ferroptosis process was confirmed as a cell swelling and cell membrane disruption process driven by notable intracellular ROS and LPO accumulation. The proposed LDM showed an encouraging lung retention property and extraordinary antitumor ability in an orthotropic lung tumor murine model. In conclusion, the constructed ferroptosis nanoinducer could be a potential tailored nanoplatform for nebulization-based pulmonary delivery and underscore the application of Ca2+-burst-centered ER stress enhanced lung cancer ferroptosis therapy.","2023-03-28","2024-07-04 23:03:13","2024-07-06 01:41:31","2024-07-04 23:03:09","5486-5502","","6","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/3QCGGGSK/Fu et al. - 2023 - Inhalable Biomineralized Liposomes for Cyclic Ca2+.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To fully exploit this in situ LLC platform with both injectability and sprayability, we focused on the treatment of both hormone-sensitive (HSPC) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). For HSPC, we found that spraying leuprolide and a cabazitaxel-loaded LLC platform on the tumor bed after resection greatly reduced tumor metastatic rate and prolonged the survival time. Besides, for CRPC, our results demonstrated that although leuprolide (a kind of drug for castration) alone could hardly limit the progression of CRPC with low MHC-I expression, its combination with cabazitaxel in our LLC platform achieved a significantly better tumor-inhibiting and anti-recurrent efficacy than single cabazitaxel-loaded LLC platform, owing to enhanced CD4+ T cell infiltration in tumors and immune-potentiating cytokines.

One major limitation is the insufficient sensitivity of nanopores in detecting disease biomarkers, which are typically present at pM or lower concentrations in biological fluids, while a second limitation is the general absence of unique nanopore signals for different analytes. To bridge this gap, we have developed a strategy for nanopore-based biomarker detection that utilizes immunocapture, isothermal rolling circle amplification, and sequence-specific fragmentation of the product to release multiple DNA reporter molecules for nanopore detection. These DNA fragment reporters produce sets of nanopore signals that form distinctive fingerprints, or clusters. This fingerprint signature therefore allows the identification and quantification of biomarker analytes. As a proof of concept, we quantify human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) at low pM levels in a few hours. Future improvement of this method by integration with a nanopore array and microfluidics-based chemistry can further reduce the limit of detection, allow multiplexed biomarker detection, and further reduce the footprint and cost of existing laboratory and point-of-care devices.","2023-03-28","2024-07-04 23:07:04","2024-07-06 01:40:31","2024-07-04 23:05:24","5412-5420","","6","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/77SY2ZI3/Kang et al. - 2023 - Nanopore-Based Fingerprint Immunoassay Based on Ro.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The experiment was conducted in a growth chamber at 25 °C, with a relative humidity of 80% and a 16 h/8 h light–dark cycle (600 lx light intensity) for 30 days.

Uncapped and OA-capped SPIONs did not significantly affect soil microbial community. Our results showed an impairment in the soil microbial community exposed to free UA, leading to a general decrease in negative effects on soil-based parameters when bioactive was loaded into the nanoscale magnetic carrier. Besides, compared to control, the free UA caused a significant decrease in microbial biomass C (39%), on the activity of acid protease (59%), and acid phosphatase (23%) enzymes, respectively. Free UA also reduced eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene abundance, suggesting a major impact on fungi. Our findings indicate that SPIONs as bioherbicide nanocarriers can reduce the negative impacts on soil.

This is particularly interesting because it demonstrates that a slightly nonracemic mixture of enantiomers can be further purified simply by adsorption onto an achiral surface. In this work, we seek a deeper understanding of this phenomena and apply scanning tunneling microscopy to image the overlayer structures formed by mixed monolayers of d- and l-Asp on Cu(111) over the full range of surface enantiomeric excess; ees = −1 (pure l-Asp) through ees = 0 (racemic dl-Asp) to ees = 1 (pure d-Asp). Both enantiomers of three chiral monolayer structures are observed. One is a conglomerate (enantiomerically pure), another is a racemate (equimolar mixture of d- and l-Asp); however, the third structure accommodates both enantiomers in a 2:1 ratio. Such solid phases of enantiomer mixtures with nonracemic composition are rare in 3D crystals of enantiomers. We argue that, in 2D, the formation of chiral defects in a lattice of one enantiomer is easier than in 3D, simply because the stress associated with the chiral defect in a 2D monolayer of the opposite enantiomer can be dissipated by strain into the space above the surface.","2023-03-28","2024-07-04 23:07:04","2024-07-06 01:41:41","2024-07-04 23:05:26","5799-5807","","6","17","","ACS Nano","Molecular Origins of Chiral Amplification on an Achiral Surface","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/2PT5QFBS/Cramer et al. - 2023 - Molecular Origins of Chiral Amplification on an Ac.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we report the development of bionic micropumps for active transmembrane transportation of molecular cargos across living cells that is realized by enzyme-powered microrobotic jets.

Therefore, once naturally endocytosed by the cell, the microjet enables the diffusion and, more importantly, active transportation of molecular substances between the extracellular and intracellular ends with the assistance of generated microflow, thus serving as an artificial biomimetic micropump. Furthermore, by constructing enzymatic micropumps on cancer cell membranes, enhanced delivery of anticancer doxorubicin into cells as well as improved killing efficacy are achieved, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the active transmembrane drug transport strategy in cancer treatment.

Molecularly imprinted nanoparticle (MINP) receptors are reported in this work to strongly and selectively bind specific segments of Aβ40.

We established a porphyrin-LNP by incorporating porphyrin-lipids into the clinically approved Onpattro formulation. The porphyrin-LNP maintained the physical properties of an LNP and generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) when irradiated with near-infrared (NIR) light. Using confocal microscopy, we revealed that porphyrin-lipids within the LNP translocate to endosomal membranes during endocytosis. The translocated porphyrin-lipids generated ROS under light irradiation and enabled LASER through endosomal membranes disruption as observed through GAL-9 recruitment and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). By establishing a quantitative confocal imaging method, we confirmed that porphyrin-LNPs can increase siRNA endosomal escape efficiency by up to 2-fold via LASER and further enhance luciferase target knockdown by 4-fold more in luciferase-transfected prostate cancer cells. Finally, we formulated porphyrin-LNPs encapsulated with gold nanoparticles (GNP) and visualized the LASER effect within prostate tumors via TEM, confirming the light-activated endosomal membrane disruption and subsequent GNP release into cytosols in vivo.

Here, we use high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) to investigate Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) and its dynamics of DNA binding and cleavage. Upon binding to single-guide RNA (sgRNA), SaCas9 forms a close bilobed structure that transiently and flexibly adopts also an open configuration. The SaCas9-mediated DNA cleavage is characterized by release of cleaved DNA and immediate dissociation, confirming that SaCas9 operates as a multiple turnover endonuclease. According to present knowledge, the process of searching for target DNA is mainly governed by three-dimensional diffusion. Independent HS-AFM experiments show a potential long-range attractive interaction between SaCas9-sgRNA and its target DNA. The interaction precedes the formation of the stable ternary complex and is observed exclusively in the vicinity of the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM), up to distances of several nanometers. The direct visualization of the process by sequential topographic images suggests that SaCas9-sgRNA binds to the target sequence first, while the following binding of the PAM is accompanied by local DNA bending and formation of the stable complex.

However, the fundamental question as to whether the antibacterial mechanism of GMs originates from parallel interaction or perpendicular interaction, or from a combination of these, remains poorly understood. Here, we show both experimentally and theoretically that GMs with high surface oxygen content (SOC) predominantly attach in parallel to the bacterial cell surface when in the suspension phase. The interaction mode shifts to perpendicular interaction when the SOC reaches a threshold of ∼0.3 (the atomic percent of O in the total atoms). Such distinct interaction modes are highly related to the rigidity of GMs. Graphene oxide (GO) with high SOC is very flexible and thus can wrap bacteria while reduced GO (rGO) with lower SOC has higher rigidity and tends to contact bacteria with their edges. Neither mode necessarily kills bacteria. Rather, bactericidal activity depends on the interaction of GMs with surrounding biomolecules. These findings suggest that variation of SOC of GMs is a key factor driving the interaction mode with bacteria, thus helping to understand the different possible physical mechanisms leading to their antibacterial activity.","2023-04-11","2024-07-04 23:07:04","2024-07-06 01:34:04","2024-07-04 23:05:45","6350-6361","","7","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/Z8EJFY7A/Guo et al. - 2023 - Defining the Surface Oxygen Threshold That Switche.pdf; /Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/E8QURSD7/Guo et al. - 2023 - Defining the Surface Oxygen Threshold That Switche.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we show that aggregation of cationic gold nanoparticles (GNP) can be modulated by multivalent anionic nanoparticle binding of an adenosine-based nucleotide and enzyme, alkaline phosphatase. We further demonstrate two different types of their autonomous aggregation pattern: (i) by introducing an enzyme gradient that modulates the synergistic nonequilibrium interactivity of the nanoparticle, nucleotide, and enzyme both in microfluidic conditions and at the macroscale; and (ii) the surface deposition pattern from evaporating droplets via the coffee ring effect.

However, current therapeutic strategies commonly eliminate infection utilizing the explosive generation of ROS, which exacerbates the redox imbalance, aggravating immune disorders and promoting infection chronicity. Herein, a self-homeostasis immunoregulatory strategy based on a luteolin (Lut)-loaded copper (Cu2+)-doped hollow mesoporous organosilica nanoparticle system (Lut@Cu-HN) is designed to cure IRIs by remodeling the redox balance. In the acidic infection environment, Lut@Cu-HN is continuously degraded to release Lut and Cu2+. As both an antibacterial and immunomodulatory agent, Cu2+ kills bacteria directly and promotes macrophage pro-inflammatory phenotype polarization to activate the antibacterial immune response. Simultaneously, Lut scavenges excessive ROS to prevent the Cu2+-exacerbated redox imbalance from impairing macrophage activity and function, thus reducing Cu2+ immunotoxicity. The synergistic effect of Lut and Cu2+ confers excellent antibacterial and immunomodulatory properties to Lut@Cu-HN. As demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, Lut@Cu-HN self-regulates immune homeostasis through redox balance remodeling, ultimately facilitating IRI eradication and tissue regeneration.","2023-03-14","2024-07-04 23:07:04","2024-07-06 01:47:44","2024-07-04 23:05:51","4574-4590","","5","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/4C2Z96AJ/Xu et al. - 2023 - Self-Homeostasis Immunoregulatory Strategy for Imp.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This inhibits the combination with Gram-positive bacterial membrane but destroys the membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, resulting in selective ablation to Gram-negative bacteria.

Herein, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive, transformable, and triple-targeting dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) nanotherapy was developed for ischemic stroke. To this end, a ROS-responsive nanovehicle (OCN) was first constructed using a cyclodextrin-derived material, which showed considerably enhanced cellular uptake in brain endothelial cells due to notably reduced particle size, morphological transformation, and surface chemistry switching upon triggering via pathological signals. Compared to a nonresponsive nanovehicle, this ROS-responsive and transformable nanoplatform OCN exhibited a significantly higher brain accumulation in a mouse model of ischemic stroke, thereby affording notably potentiated therapeutic effects for the nanotherapy derived from NBP-containing OCN. For OCN decorated with a stroke-homing peptide (SHp), we found significantly increased transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis, in addition to the previously recognized targeting capability to activated neurons. Consistently, the engineered transformable and triple-targeting nanoplatform, i.e., SHp-decorated OCN (SON), displayed a more efficient distribution in the injured brain in mice with ischemic stroke, showing considerable localization in endothelial cells and neurons. Furthermore, the finally formulated ROS-responsive transformable and triple-targeting nanotherapy (NBP-loaded SON) demonstrated highly potent neuroprotective activity in mice, which outperformed the SHp-deficient nanotherapy at a 5-fold higher dose. Mechanistically, our bioresponsive, transformable, and triple-targeting nanotherapy attenuated the ischemia/reperfusion-induced endothelial permeability and improved dendritic remodeling and synaptic plasticity of neurons in the injured brain tissue, thereby promoting much better functional recovery, which were achieved by efficiently enhancing NBP delivery to the ischemic brain tissue, targeting injured endothelial cells and activated neurons/microglial cells, and normalizing the pathological microenvironment. Moreover, preliminary studies indicated that the ROS-responsive NBP nanotherapy displayed a good safety profile. Consequently, the developed triple-targeting NBP nanotherapy with desirable targeting efficiency, spatiotemporally controlled drug release performance, and high translational potential holds great promise for precision therapy of ischemic stroke and other brain diseases.","2023-03-14","2024-07-04 23:07:04","2024-07-06 01:47:10","2024-07-04 23:05:59","4813-4833","","5","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/EER9A3GG/Yang et al. - 2023 - Reactive Oxygen Species-Responsive Transformable a.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that PrP fibrils exist as a population of competing conformers, which are selectively amplified under different conditions and can “mutate” during elongation. Prion replication therefore possesses the steps necessary for molecular evolution analogous to the quasispecies concept of genetic organisms. We monitored structure and growth of single PrP fibrils by total internal reflection and transient amyloid binding super-resolution microscopy and detected at least two main fibril populations, which emerged from seemingly homogeneous PrP seeds. All PrP fibrils elongated in a preferred direction by an intermittent “stop-and-go” mechanism, but each population possessed distinct elongation mechanisms that incorporated either unfolded or partially folded monomers. Elongation of RML and ME7 prion rods likewise exhibited distinct kinetic features. The discovery of polymorphic fibril populations growing in competition, which were previously hidden in ensemble measurements, suggests that prions and other amyloid replicating by prion-like mechanisms may represent quasispecies of structural isomorphs that can evolve to adapt to new hosts and conceivably could evade therapeutic intervention.","2023-04-11","2024-07-04 23:07:04","2024-07-06 01:24:45","2024-07-04 23:06:00","6575-6588","","7","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/753T4EPZ/Sun et al. - 2023 - Direct Observation of Competing Prion Protein Fibr.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our design, therapeutic proteins are mixed with FCS to form nanoparticles, lyophilized with appropriate excipients, and then filled into enteric capsules for oral administration.

Within the low tissue absorption window, shifting to longer excitation wavelengths reduces tissue scattering and boosts penetration depth. Recently, the 2200 nm excitation window has emerged as the last and longest window suitable for deep-brain MPM. However, multiphoton fluorescence imaging at this window has not been demonstrated, due to the lack of characterization of multiphoton properties of fluorescent labels. Here we demonstrate technologies for measuring both the multiphoton excitation and emission properties of fluorescent labels at the 2200 nm window, using (1) 3-photon (ησ3) and 4-photon action cross sections (ησ4) and (2) 3-photon and 4-photon emission spectra both ex vivo and in vivo of quantum dots. Our results show that quantum dots have exceptionally large ησ3 and ησ4 for efficient generation of multiphoton fluorescence. Besides, the 3-photon and 4-photon emission spectra of quantum dots are essentially identical to those of one-photon emission, which change negligibly subject to the local environment of circulating blood. Based on these characterization results, we further demonstrate deep-brain vasculature imaging in vivo. Due to the superb multiphoton properties of quantum dots, 3-photon and 4-photon fluorescence imaging reaches a maximum brain imaging depth of 1060 and 940 μm below the surface of a mouse brain, respectively, which enables the imaging of subcortical structures.

Photosynthesis is greatly limited at the initial carboxylation reaction, where CO2 is converted to the organic acid 3-PGA, catalyzed by the RuBisCO enzyme. RuBisCO has poor affinity for CO2, but also the CO2 concentration at the RuBisCO site is limited by the diffusion of atmospheric CO2 through the various leaf compartments to the reaction site. Beyond genetic engineering, nanotechnology can offer a materials-based approach for enhancing photosynthesis, and yet, it has mostly been explored for the light-dependent reactions. In this work, we developed polyethyleneimine-based nanoparticles for enhancing the carboxylation reaction. We demonstrate that the nanoparticles can capture CO2 in the form of bicarbonate and increase the CO2 that reacts with the RuBisCO enzyme, enhancing the 3-PGA production in in vitro assays by 20%. The nanoparticles can be introduced to the plant via leaf infiltration and, because of the functionalization with chitosan oligomers, they do not induce any toxic effect to the plant. In the leaves, the nanoparticles localize in the apoplastic space but also spontaneously reach the chloroplasts where photosynthetic activity takes place. Their CO2 loading-dependent fluorescence verifies that, in vivo, they maintain their ability to capture CO2 and can be therefore reloaded with atmospheric CO2 while in planta. Our results contribute to the development of a nanomaterials-based CO2-concentrating mechanism in plants that can potentially increase photosynthetic efficiency and overall plants’ CO2 storage.","2023-02-28","2024-07-04 23:07:04","2024-07-06 02:03:38","2024-07-04 23:06:06","3430-3441","","4","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/742H29FD/Routier et al. - 2023 - Chitosan-Modified Polyethyleneimine Nanoparticles .pdf; /Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/AYYZ8W2I/Routier et al. - 2023 - Chitosan-Modified Polyethyleneimine Nanoparticles .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The NPs can be conveniently armed in a plug-and-play pattern with SpyTag003-linked antigens. Nov-S-Catcher003 was efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli and self-assembled into highly uniform NPs with a purified protein yield of 97.8 mg/L. The NPs presented high stability at different maintained temperatures and after undergoing differing numbers of freeze–thaw cycles. Tumor vaccine candidates were easily obtained by modifying Nov-S-Catcher003 NPs with SpyTag003-linked tumor antigens. Nov-S-Catcher003-antigen NPs significantly promoted the maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells in vitro and were capable of efficiently migrating to lymph nodes in vivo. In TC-1 and B16F10 tumor-bearing mice, the subcutaneous immunization of NPs elicited robust tumor-specific T-cell immunity, reshaped the tumor microenvironment, and inhibited tumor growth.

It is revealed that CRB shows a uniform size distribution, prolonged blood circulation time, and excellent tumor targeting ability. Moreover, controlled release of CPT and NO were observed both in vitro and in vivo under the stimulation of ultrasound, which is beneficial to the depletion of dense stroma and subsequently enhanced delivery and efficacy of CPT.

The oxidative enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO), which is mostly produced by polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (NEU), has been identified as a key player in lipid peroxidation in inflamed tissues. Considering that the expression of MPO was much higher in NASH than in the nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) with steatosis, we designed a nanoparticle platform based on ultrasmall iron oxide (USIO) nanoparticles to realize MPO-sensitive NASH diagnosis. After modification of USIO nanoparticles with amphiphilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and conjugation with 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT), a physiological substrate for MPO, the final nanocomposite (USIO-DA-PEG-5HT) revealed MPO-mediated aggregation at the inflammatory site of NASH. Meanwhile, the intrinsic T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) signal of dispersed USIO-DA-PEG-5HT nanoparticles diminishes, while the T2-weighted MR signal is amplified owing to the aggregation effect.

Briefly, a perfluorocarbon nanoemulsion (PFTBA@LIP) consisting of a perfluorotributylamine core and a lipid monolayer is fabricated, which is encapsulated in the thermoresponsive hydrogel. Ozone is then dissolved in the nanoemulsion owing to its high affinity to PFTBA (O3/PFTBA@LIP@Gel), which effectively improves its stability.

However, the application of OA is strictly limited by its short half-life and low available concentration in the target organ. Herein, based on our previous research, an OA-based nanotherapy coated with a neutrophil membrane highly expressing RVG29, RVG29-H-NPOA, was successfully constructed by computer simulation-guided supramolecular assembly of polyethylenimine and OA. The in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that RVG29-H-NPOA could target and be distributed in the injured brain focus via the relay-targeted delivery mediated by RVG29-induced blood–brain barrier (BBB) penetration and neutrophil membrane protein-induced BBB binding and injury targeting. This results in enhancements of the antioxidant, antiapoptotic, mitochondrial stability-promoting and anti-inflammatory effects of OA and exhibited systematic alleviation of astrocyte injury, neuronal damage, and inflammatory response in the brain. Due to their systematic intervention in multiple pathological processes, RVG29-H-NPOA significantly increased the 24 h survival rate of CA/CPR model rats from 40% to 100% and significantly improved their neurological functions.

To address the unmet need, we develop a paper-based surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)-vertical flow biosensor, named iREX (integrated Raman spectroscopic EXO) biosensor, for multiplexed quantitative profiling of exosomal proteins in clinical serum samples of patients. Utilizing this iREX biosensor, we are able to quantitatively profile MUC1, HER2 and CEA in EXO samples derived from various breast cancer cell subtypes. The results show discriminative expression profiles of the three exosomal proteins in these cell subtypes, which allows for accurate diagnosis and molecular subtyping of breast cancer. We further validate the clinical utility of the iREX biosensor for simultaneous quantitative analysis of MUC1, HER2 and CEA in patient’s blood serums, thereby aiding in noninvasive breast cancer subtyping and longitudinal treatment monitoring. Our iREX biosensor integrating the SERS detection in a vertical flow diagnostic device offers great advantages of high sensitivity, molecular specificity, powerful multiplexing capability, and high diagnostic accuracy.

Herein, a facile assembly strategy of a block copolymer was developed to fabricate a mesoporous CoFeB amorphous alloy with abundant metallic Co/Fe atoms, which served as an ideal scaffold for well-dispersed loading of Au nanoparticles (∼3.1 nm) via the galvanic replacement reaction. The prepared Au–CoFeB possessed high saturation magnetization as well as uniform and large open mesopores (∼12.5 nm), which provided ample accessibility to biomolecules, such as nucleic acids, enzymes, proteins, and antibodies. Through this distinctive combination of superparamagnetism (CoFeB) and biofavorability (Au), the resulting Au–CoFeB was employed as a dispersible nanovehicle for the direct capture and isolation of p53 autoantibody from serum samples. Highly sensitive detection of the autoantibody was achieved with a limit of detection of 0.006 U/mL, which was 50 times lower than that of the conventional p53-ELISA kit-based detection system.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes disorders involving chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and is considered incurable despite a variety of treatment options. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is one of the gasotransmitters that carries out anti-inflammatory functions and has shown promising immunomodulatory effects in various inflammatory diseases including IBD.

We identified the ideal PEG type and ratio of liposome for a high stability, loading efficiency, and spleen targeting effect. In the treatment of the DSS-induced colitis model, we found that ST-H2S lipo and conventional long-circulating liposomes loaded with H2S donors (LC-H2S lipo) reduced the severity of colitis, whereas unloaded H2S donors did not. Furthermore, the therapeutic effect of ST-H2S lipo was superior to that of LC-H2S lipo due to its better systemic immunomodulatory effect than that of LC-H2S lipo.

To overcome this limitation, we developed a metasurface platform that generates multiple axial foci, which multiplies the volumetric OCT imaging speed by offering several focal planes.

The imaging speed can be further improved in a sparse sample, e.g., 7-fold with a seven-foci beam.

In this design, the macrophage membrane was coated onto Chl to form macrophage-mimetic Chl (MChl) to increase its biocompatibility and targeted tumor accumulation driven by the inflammatory-homing effects of macrophage membranes. In addition, the membrane coating on Chl allowed lipid insertion to yield β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) modified MChl (CD-MChl). Subsequently, supramolecular conjugates of MChl-NP were constructed via host–guest interactions between CD-MChl and adamantane (ADA)-modified liposome (ADA-NP), and the anchored liposome went with CD-MChl hand-in-hand to the tumor tissues for co-delivery of Chl, hematoporphyrin, and chloroquine phosphate (loaded in ADA-NP).

Here, we evaluated potential intestinal injury in the offspring of adult mice that were subjected to maternal 80 nm polystyrene nanoparticle (PS-NP) exposure during gestation. PS-NP exposure significantly reduced the birth weight of female mice compared with male mice. However, the adult body weights of the female and male offspring were substantially greater in the PS-NP-exposed groups. Additionally, we found that exposure to PS-NPs during pregnancy caused histological changes in the small intestines of both female and male offspring. Mechanistic analysis revealed upregulation of reactive oxygen species in the small intestines, as indicated by changes in the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Furthermore, exposure to PS-NPs led to downregulation of GPx4, FTH1, and FTL protein levels, indicating initiation of ferroptosis. Notably, the changes in mRNA expression levels of GPx4, FTH1, and FTL differed between female and male offspring. Although all phenotypes failed to demonstrate classic dose-dependent effects, the data imply that small intestinal toxicity is greater in female offspring than in male offspring.

Whereas conventional electrical stimulation techniques have failed to produce naturalistic visual percepts, nanoparticle-based optical sensors have recently received increasing attention as a means to artificially stimulate the RGCs. In particular, nanoparticle-enhanced infrared neural modulation (NINM) is a plasmonically mediated photothermal neuromodulation technique that has a demonstrated capacity for both stimulation and inhibition, which is essential for the differential modulation of ON-type and OFF-type RGCs. Gold nanorods provide tunable absorption through the near-infrared wavelength window, which reduces interference with any residual vision. Therefore, NINM may be uniquely well-suited to retinal prosthesis applications but, to our knowledge, has not previously been demonstrated in RGCs. In the present study, NINM laser pulses of 100 μs, 500 μs and 200 ms were applied to RGCs in explanted rat retinae, with single-cell responses recorded via patch-clamping. The shorter laser pulses evoked robust RGC stimulation by capacitive current generation, while the long laser pulses are capable of inhibiting spontaneous action potentials by thermal block. Importantly, an implicit bias toward OFF-type inhibition is observed, which may have important implications for the feasibility of future high-acuity retinal prosthesis design based on nanoparticle sensors.","2023-02-14","2024-07-04 23:07:04","2024-07-06 02:18:59","2024-07-04 23:06:35","2079-2088","","3","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/SY26JUU8/Begeng et al. - 2023 - Activity of Retinal Neurons Can Be Modulated by Tu.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is found that Au15(NAC)13 shows higher structural stability than Au15(MMPA)13 and Au15(MPA)13 against external stimuli (e.g., pH, oxidants, and temperature) because of the intramolecular hydrogen bonds. More importantly, detailed enzymatic kinetics data show that the catalytic activity of Au15(NAC)13 is about 4.3 and 2.7 times higher than the catalytic activity of Au15(MMPA)13 and Au15(MPA)13, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the Au atoms on the motif of Au NCs should be the active centers, whereas the superior peroxidase mimic activity of Au15(NAC)13 should originate from the emptier orbitals of Au atoms because of the electron-withdrawing effect of acetyl amino group in NAC.

Achieving vascular normalization is an urgent problem that must be solved when treating inflammatory vascular diseases. Inspired by the vascular regulatory versatility of nitric oxide (NO) produced by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) catalyzing l-arginine (l-Arg), the eNOS-activating effects of l-Arg, and the powerful anti-inflammatory and eNOS-replenishing effects of budesonide (BUD), we constructed a bi-prodrug minimalist nanoplatform co-loaded with BUD and l-Arg via polysialic acid (PSA) to form BUD-l-Arg@PSA. This promoted vascular normalization by simultaneously regulating vascular endothelial dysfunction and inflammation. Mediated by the special affinity between PSA and E-selectin, which is highly expressed on the surface of activated endothelial cells (ECs), BUD-l-Arg@PSA selectively accumulated in activated ECs, targeted eNOS expression and activation, and promoted NO production. Consequently, the binary synergistic regulation of the NO/eNOS signaling pathway occurred and improved vascular endothelial function. NO-induced nuclear factor-kappa B alpha inhibitor (IκBα) stabilization and BUD-induced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) response gene site occupancy achieved dual-site blockade of the NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby reducing the inflammatory response and inhibiting the infiltration of inflammation-related immune cells. In a renal ischemia-reperfusion injury mouse model, BUD-l-Arg@PSA reduced acute injury. In an atherosclerosis mouse model, BUD-l-Arg@PSA decreased atherosclerotic plaque burden and improved vasodilation.

Here, we investigate the drying, liquid crystalline structures, and deposit patterns of colloidal liquid crystalline droplets undergoing liquid–liquid crystalline phase separation (LLCPS) during evaporation. We show that evaporation-induced progressive up-concentration inside the drying droplets makes it possible to cross, at different speeds, various thermodynamic stability states in solutions of amyloid fibril rigid filamentous colloids, thus allowing access to both metastable states, where phase separation occurs via nucleation and growth, as well as to unstable states, where phase separation occurs via the more elusive spinodal decomposition, leading to the formation of liquid crystalline microdroplets (or tactoids) of different shapes. We present the tactoids “phase diagram” as a function of the position within the droplet and elucidate their hydrodynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the presence of the amyloid fibrils not only does not enhance the pinning behavior during droplet evaporation but also slightly suppresses it, thus minimizing the coffee-ring effect. We observed that microsize domains with cholesteric structure emerge in the drying droplet close to the droplet’s initial edge, yet such domains are not connected to form a uniform cholesteric dried film. Finally, we demonstrate that a fully cholesteric dried layer can be generated from the drying droplets by regulating the kinetics of the evaporation process.","2023-02-14","2024-07-04 23:07:04","2024-07-06 02:19:04","2024-07-04 23:06:40","3098-3106","","3","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/KA9DKSJD/Almohammadi et al. - 2023 - Evaporation-Driven Liquid–Liquid Crystalline Phase.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, to date, the role of KDM6B in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) remains controversial. Here, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) proved that KDM6B derived from osteogenic-induced BMSCs could bind to the promoter region of BMDMs’ brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein-1 (BMAL1) gene in a coculture system and activate BMAL1. Transcriptome sequencing and experiments in vitro showed that the overexpression of BMAL1 in BMDM could inhibit the TLR2/NF-κB signaling pathway, reduce pyroptosis, and decrease the M1/M2 ratio, thereby promoting osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Furthermore, bone and macrophage dual-targeted GSK-J4 (KDM6B inhibitor)-loaded nanodiscs were synthesized via binding SDSSD-apoA-1 peptide analogs (APA) peptide, which indirectly proved the critical role of KDM6B in osteogenesis in vivo. Overall, we demonstrated that KDM6B serves as a positive circulation trigger during osteogenic differentiation by decreasing the ratio of M1/M2 both in vitro and in vivo.

However, to date, we still lack mechanistic evidence for how soil-applied Si NDs alter the regulation of plant physical and chemical defenses against insect herbivores. To address this gap, we compared the effect of fluorescent amine-functionalized Si NDs (5 nm) and the conventional fertilizer sodium silicate on maize (Zea mays L.) physical and chemical defenses against the oriental armyworm (Mythimna separata, Walker) caterpillars. We found that 50 mg/kg Si NDs and sodium silicate additions inhibited the growth of caterpillars the most (35.7% and 22.8%, respectively) as compared to other application doses (0, 10, and 150 mg/kg). Both Si NDs and silicate addition activated biosynthesis genes responsible for chemical (benzoxazinoids) and physical (lignin) defense production. Moreover, Si NDs upregulated the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and POD) and promoted the antioxidant metabolism (flavonoids) in maize leaves under M. separata attack. Finally, we show that, under field conditions, Si ND addition increased maize cob weight (28.7%), cob grain weight (40.8%), and 100-grain weight (26.5%) as compared to the control, and more so than the conventional silicon fertilizer.

Previous studies with fluorescently labeled expansile nanoparticles, or “eNPs”, demonstrated a high specificity of eNPs to tumors that is achieved through a materials-based targeting strategy. However, fluorescent labeling techniques are primarily qualitative in nature and the gold-standard for quantitative evaluation of biodistribution is through radiolabeling. In this manuscript, we synthesize 14C-labeled eNPs to quantitatively evaluate the biodistribution of these particles in a murine model of intraperitoneal mesothelioma via liquid scintillation counting. The results demonstrate a strong specificity of eNPs for tumors that lasts one to 2 weeks postinjection with an overall delivery efficiency to the tumor tissue of 30% of the injected dose which is congruent with prior reports of preclinical efficacy of the technology. Importantly, the route of administration is essential to the eNP’s material-based targeting strategy with intraperitoneal administration leading to tumoral accumulation while, in contrast, intravenous administration leads to rapid clearance via the reticuloendothelial system and low tumoral accumulation. A comparison against nanoparticle delivery systems published over the past decade shows that the 30% tumoral delivery efficiency of the eNP is significantly higher than the 0.7% median delivery efficiency of other systems with sufficient quantitative data to define this metric.

Here, we investigated the internalization and transformation of HgSNP in microbial methylator Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA through total Hg analysis and different Hg species quantification in medium and cytoplasm. We found that the microbial uptake of HgSNP, via a passive diffusion pathway, was significantly higher than that of the Hg2+-dissolved organic matter (Hg2+-DOM) complex. Internalized HgSNP were dissolved to Hg2+ in cytoplasm with a maximal dissolution of 41%, suggesting a “Trojan horse” mechanism. The intracellular Hg2+ from HgSNP exposure at the initial stage (8 h) was higher than that in Hg2+-DOM group, which led to higher methylation of HgSNP. Furthermore, no differences in methylmercury (MeHg) production from HgSNP were observed between the hgcAB gene knockout (ΔhgcAB) and wild-type strains, suggesting that HgSNP methylation may occur through HgcAB-independent pathways. Considering the possibility of a broad range of hgcAB-lacking microbes serving as methylators for HgSNP and the ubiquity of HgSNP in anoxic environments, this study highlights the importance of HgSNP internalization and methylation in MeHg production and demonstrates the necessity of understanding the assimilation and transformation of nutrient and toxic metal nanoparticles in general.","2023-02-14","2024-07-04 23:07:04","2024-07-06 02:16:35","2024-07-04 23:06:53","1925-1934","","3","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/WW4GK86Z/Guo et al. - 2023 - “Trojan Horse” Type Internalization Increases the .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the existing signal segmentation methods can extract SOI and remove artifacts by blind source separation and/or additional filters, they may restrict the recognizable patterns of the device, and even cause signal distortion.

The programmable SSR endows the sensor with a critical window of responsiveness, realizing the perception of signals on demand.

However, the confounding effects of physical and biochemical cues of nanotopography hinder the understanding of nanotopography in regulating cell behavior, which ultimately limits the biomedical applications of nanotopography. To delineate the roles of the physical and biochemical cues in cell regulation, we fabricate substrates that have either the same physical nanotopography but different biochemical (FN) nanopatterns or identical FN nanopatterns but different physical nanotopographies. We then examine the influences of physical and biochemical cues of nanotopography on spreading, nuclear deformation, mechanotransduction, and function of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Our results reveal that physical topographies, especially nanogratings, dominantly control cell spreading, YAP localization, proliferation, and differentiation of hMSCs. However, biochemical FN nanopatterns affect hMSC elongation, YAP intracellular localization, and lamin a/c (LAMAC) expression. Furthermore, we find that physical nanogratings induce nanoscale curvature of nuclei at the basal side, which attenuates the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs.

Can it play a role in resistance of postoperative infection of implants, especially with an extracellular supplement of Fe ions in a non-cytotoxic dose? To answer this, “nanoswords” of Fe-doped titanite are fabricated on a Ti implant surface to resist bacterial invasion by a synergistic action of ferroptosis-like bacteria killing, proton disturbance, and physical puncture. The related antibiosis mechanism is explored by atomic force microscopy and genome sequencing. The nanoswords induce an increased local pH value, which not only weakens the proton motive force, reducing adenosine triphosphate synthesis of Staphylococcus aureus, but also decreases the membrane modulus, making the nanoswords distort and even puncture a bacterial membrane easily. Simultaneously, more Fe ions are taken by bacteria due to increased bacterial membrane permeability, resulting in ferroptosis-like death of bacteria, and this is demonstrated by intracellular iron enrichment, lipid peroxidation, and glutathione depletion. Interestingly, a microenvironment constructed by these nanoswords improves osteoblast behavior in vitro and bone regeneration in vivo. Overall, the nanoswords can induce ferroptosis-like bacterial death without cytotoxicity and have great promise in applications with clinical implants for outstanding antibiosis and biointegration performance.","2023-02-14","2024-07-04 23:07:04","2024-07-06 02:08:51","2024-07-04 23:07:01","2711-2724","","3","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/UFDIYF5I/Xue et al. - 2023 - Alkaline “Nanoswords” Coordinate Ferroptosis-like .pdf","","Others","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The EVs have been widely studied as biological cargo containing essential biological information not only from inside vesicles such as nucleic acids and proteins but also from outside vesicles such as membrane proteins and glycolipids. Although various methods have been developed to isolate EVs with high yields such as captures based on density, size, and immunoaffinity, different measurement systems are needed to analyze EVs after isolation, and a platform that enables all-in-one analysis of EVs from capture to detection in multiple samples is desired. Since a nanowire-based approach has shown an effective capability for capturing EVs via surface charge interaction compared to other conventional methods, here, we upgraded the conventional well plate assay to an all-in-one nanowire-integrated well plate assay system (i.e., a nanowire assay system) that enables charge-based EV capture and EV analysis of membrane proteins. We applied the nanowire assay system to analyze EVs from brain tumor organoids in which tumor environments, including vascular formations, were reconstructed, and we found that the membrane protein expression ratio of CD31/CD63 was 1.42-fold higher in the tumor organoid-derived EVs with a p-value less than 0.05. Furthermore, this ratio for urine samples from glioblastoma patients was 2.25-fold higher than that from noncancer subjects with a p-value less than 0.05 as well. Our results demonstrated that the conventional well plate method integrated with the nanowire-based EV capture approach allows users not only to capture EVs effectively but also to analyze them in one assay system.

Here, we applied a cross-disciplinary experimental approach to understand structure, function, and formation of mechanical gradients in byssal threads─collagen-based fibers used by marine mussels to anchor on hard surfaces. The proximal end of threads is approximately 50-fold less stiff and twice as extensible as the distal end.

One of the binary colloidal crystals, composed of 5 μm Si and 400 nm poly(methyl methacrylate) particles named 5PM, has been applied as a substrate for hPSCs cultivation and cardiac differentiation. In this study, cell nucleus, cytoskeleton, and epigenetic states of human induced pluripotent stem cells on the 5PM were analyzed using atomic force microscopy, molecular biology assays, and the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq). Cells were more spherical with stiffer cell nuclei on the 5PM compared to the flat control. ATAC-seq revealed that chromatin accessibility decreased on the 5PM, caused by the increased entry of histone lysine methyltransferase SETDB1 into the cell nuclei and the amplified level of histone H3K9me3 modification. Reducing cytoskeleton tension using a ROCK inhibitor attenuated the nuclear accumulation of SETDB1 on the 5PM, indicating that the effect is cytoskeleton-dependent. In addition, the knockdown of SETDB1 reversed the promotive effects of the 5PM on cardiac differentiation, demonstrating that biophysical cue-induced cytoskeletal tension, cell nucleus deformation, and then SETDB1 accumulation are critical outside-in signal transformations in cardiac differentiation. Human embryonic stem cells showed similar results, indicating that the biophysical impact of the 5PM surfaces on cardiac differentiation could be universal.

Here, utilizing the long-range migration of Cu+ ions under an in-plane electric field, a lateral p-n homojunction was constructed in the 2D layered copper indium thiophosphate (CIPS). The symmetric Au/CIPS/Au devices demonstrate an electric-field-driven resistance switching (RS) accompanied by a rectification behavior without any gate control. Moreover, such rectification behavior can be continuously modulated by poling voltage. We deduce that the reversable rectifying RS behavior is governed by the effective lateral build-in potential and the change of the interfacial barrier during the poling process. Furthermore, the CIPS p-n homojuction is evidenced by the photovoltaic effect, with the spectral response extending up to the visible region due to the better photogenerated carrier separation efficiency.

Moreover, by performing T1 measurements on the same particles at different times postinfection, we found that radicals were dominantly scavenged by S. aureus from 80 min postinfection under a high intracellular oxidative stress environment.","2023-01-24","2024-07-04 23:07:51","2024-07-06 02:20:52","2024-07-04 23:07:37","1100-1111","","2","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/9BWXBYP7/Wu et al. - 2023 - Diamond Relaxometry as a Tool to Investigate the F.pdf; /Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/FGG2H4JX/Wu et al. - 2023 - Diamond Relaxometry as a Tool to Investigate the F.pdf; /Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/GN54SIU3/Wu et al. - 2023 - Diamond Relaxometry as a Tool to Investigate the F.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mitochondrial transplantation has been suggested as an effective therapeutic strategy to protect against myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury. However, its clinical translation remains limited because it requires the local injection of mitochondria into the myocardium. Here, a polypeptide, CSTSMLKAC (PEP), bound to triphenylphosphonium cations (TPP+) effectively binds mitochondria to form a PEP–TPP–mitochondrial compound. Further investigation of this compound has revealed that the ischemia-sensing properties of PEP promote its translocation into the ischemic myocardium. Additionally, the targeting peptide, PEP, readily dissociates from the PEP–TPP–mitochondrial compound, allowing for the transplanted mitochondria to be efficiently internalized by cardiomyocytes or transferred to cardiomyocytes by endothelial cells. Mitochondrial transplantation promotes cardiomyocyte energetics and mechanical contraction, subsequently reducing cellular apoptosis, macrophage infiltration, and the pro-inflammatory response, all of which lead to attenuation of ischemia–reperfusion injury. Thus, this study provides promising evidence that the PEP–TPP–mitochondrial compound effectively promotes intravenous mitochondrial transplantation into the ischemic myocardium and subsequently ameliorates myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury.","2023-01-24","2024-07-04 23:07:51","2024-07-06 01:02:28","2024-07-04 23:07:38","896-909","","2","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/5VRI338K/Sun et al. - 2023 - Intravenous Transplantation of an Ischemic-specifi.pdf; /Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/3UAT29X5/Sun et al. - 2023 - Intravenous Transplantation of an Ischemic-specifi.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Poor drug delivery is mainly due to the presence of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), and postoperative recurrence is primarily due to the resistance of GBM cells to chemotherapeutic drugs and the presence of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Herein, a biomimetic nanodrug delivery platform based on endogenous exosomes that could efficiently target the brain without targeting modifications and co-deliver pure drug nanomicelles and immune adjuvants for safe and efficient chemo-immunotherapy against GBM is prepared. Inspired by the self-assembly technology of small molecules, tanshinone IIA (TanIIA) and glycyrrhizic acid (GL), which are the inhibitors of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), self-assembled to form TanIIA-GL nanomicelles (TGM). Endogenous serum exosomes are selected to coat the pure drug nanomicelles, and the CpG oligonucleotides, agonists of Toll-like receptor 9, are anchored on the exosome membrane to obtain immune exosomes loaded with TCM self-assembled nanomicelles (CpG-EXO/TGM). Our results demonstrate that CpG-EXO/TGM can bind free transferrin in blood, prolong blood circulation, and maintain intact structures when traversing the BBB and targeting GBM cells. In the GBM microenvironment, the strong anti-GBM effect of CpG-EXO/TGM is mainly attributed to two factors: (i) highly efficient uptake by GBM cells and sufficient intracellular release of drugs to induce apoptosis and (ii) stimulation of dendritic cell maturation and induction of tumor-associated macrophages polarization by CpG oligonucleotides to generate anti-GBM immune responses.

The underlying mechanism was that Bi NP doping can endow Bi-PCN-222 MOF with self-driven charge transfer through the Schottky interface and the capability of oxidase-like and peroxidase-like activity, because a large number of free electrons can be captured by surrounding oxygen species to produce radical oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, once bacteria contact Bi-PCN-222 in a physiological environment, its appropriate redox potential can trigger electron transfer through the electron transport pathway in bacterial membranes and then the interior of the bacteria, which disturbs the bacterial respiration process and subsequent metabolism. Additionally, Bi-PCN-222 can also accelerate tissue regeneration by upregulating fibroblast proliferation and angiogenesis genes (bFGF, VEGF, and HIF-1α), thereby promoting wound healing.

The constructed nanoreactor can be specifically activated through endogenous H2O2 by an NIR-mediated “bursting-like” process to enhance its imaging and therapeutic functions. Black SnO2–x with abundant oxygen vacancies expedites effective separation of electron–hole pairs from energy-band structure and endows them with strong hyperthermia effect upon NIR laser irradiation. The generating toxic H2O2 with the assistance of GOx provides SnO2–x@AGP with the capacity of oxidative stress therapy. Ascended H2O2 can activate ABTS into ABTS•+. ABTS•+ not only possesses significant NIR absorption properties, but also disrupts intracellular glutathione to generate excessive reactive oxygen species for improved phototherapy, leading to more effective treatment together with oxidative stress therapy. Thus, SnO2–x@AGP with NIR-mediated and H2O2-activated performance presents tumor inhibition efficacy with minimized damage to normal tissues.

Eventually, Gal-NP@TPt demonstrates appreciable antitumor effects for the systemic treatment of patient-derived tumor xenografts of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Although the bacterial toxicity of BP nanosheets has been demonstrated, whether the biological response differs in pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains of a microorganism is unknown. Here, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and nonpathogenic Escherichia coli DH5α (E. coli DH5α), Escherichia coli k12 (E. coli k12), and Bacillus tropicus (B. tropicus) are used to comparatively study the microbial toxicity of BP nanosheets. Upon exposure to BP nanosheets across a range of doses from 10 to 100 μg mL–1 for 12 h, EPEC experienced enhanced growth and E. coli DH5α and E. coli k12 were not affected, whereas B. tropicus exhibited clear toxicity. By combining transcriptome sequencing, proteome analysis, and other sensitive biological techniques, the mechanism of BP-induced growth promotion for EPEC was uncovered. Briefly, BP nanosheets activate the antioxidation system to resist oxidative stress, promote protein synthesis and secretion to attenuate membrane damage, enhance the energy supply, and activate growth-related pathways. None of these impacts were evident with nonpathogenic strains. By describing the mechanism of strain-dependent microbial effects, this study not only highlights the potential risks of BP nanosheets to the environment and to human health but also calls attention to the importance of model strain selection when evaluating the hazard and toxicity of emerging nanomaterials.","2023-02-28","2024-07-04 23:07:51","2024-07-06 02:01:39","2024-07-04 23:07:44","3574-3586","","4","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ISHBJ6HM/Xiong et al. - 2023 - Transcriptome Analysis Reveals the Growth Promotio.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

C968-mediated GSH deprivation through inhibiting glutamine metabolism prevented PDT-generated reactive oxygen species from being annihilated by GSH, amplifying intracellular oxidative stress, which caused severe cell death and also enhanced the immunogenic cell death (ICD) effect. In addition, genome-wide analysis was carried out using RNA-sequencing to evaluate the changes in cell transcriptome induced by amplifying oxidative stress. Thereafter, neoantigens generated by the enhanced ICD effect promoted the maturation of dendritic cells, thereby recruiting and activating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).

Although activation of the innate immune stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway potentiates antitumor immunity and thus sensitizes tumors to ICIs, the efficient tumor penetration of STING agonists remains critically challenging. Herein, we prepare a tumor-penetrating neotype neutrophil cytopharmaceutical (NEs@STING-Mal-NP) with liposomal STING agonists conjugating on the surface of neutrophils, which is different from the typical neutrophil cytopharmaceutical that loads drugs inside the neutrophils. We show NEs@STING-Mal-NP that inherit the merits of neutrophils including proactive tumor vascular extravasation and tissue penetration significantly boost the tumor penetration of STING agonists. Moreover, the backpacked liposomal STING agonists can be released in response to hyaluronidase rich in the tumor environment, leading to enhanced uptake by tumor-infiltrating immune cells and tumor cells. Thus, NEs@STING-Mal-NP effectively activate the STING pathway and reinvigorate the tumor environment through converting macrophages and neutrophils to antitumor phenotypes, promoting the maturation of dendritic cells, and enhancing the infiltration and tumoricidal ability of T cells. Specifically, this cytopharmaceutical displays a significant inhibition on tumor growth and prolongs the survival of TNBC-bearing mice when combined with ICIs. We demonstrate that neutrophils serve as promising vehicles for delivering STING agonists throughout solid tumors and the developed neutrophil cytopharmaceuticals with backpacked STING agonists exhibit huge potential in boosting the immunotherapy of ICIs.","2023-01-24","2024-07-04 23:07:51","2024-07-06 01:00:40","2024-07-04 23:07:50","1663-1680","","2","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/9KVMJSYD/Hao et al. - 2023 - Sensitizing Tumors to Immune Checkpoint Blockage v.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) play a significant role in inducing these complications. Highly processed diets and hyperglycemia facilitate the accumulation of AGEs in the body. Interaction between AGEs and their main receptor (RAGE) initiates the transmission of intracellular inflammatory and cell death signals, which ultimately lead to complications. To counter AGEs-induced damage, we developed an siRNA-binding tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (TDN) system, termed Tsi, which combines the potent cell membrane penetrability and serum stability of TDN with the gene-targeting specificity of siRNA-RAGE. Tsi effectively and persistently downregulates the expression of RAGE, thereby suppressing inflammation by blocking the NF-κB pathway as well as exhibiting antioxidant functions. Furthermore, Tsi regulates the pyroptosis state of macrophages via the NLRP3/caspase-1 axis, which inhibits the spread of cell death signals and maintains homeostasis. This is of great significance for the synergistic treatment strategy for systemic complications in patients with refractory hyperglycemia. In summary, this study describes a nanomedicine that targets the RAGE and suppresses AGE-induced inflammation. This nucleic acid drug holds long-lasting efficacy and is independent of lowering hyperglycemia, which provides a strategy for the treatment of diabetic complications and age-related diseases.","2023-11-28","2024-07-06 02:24:40","2024-07-06 02:25:14","2024-07-06 02:24:40","22668-22683","","22","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/MQIZXHI7/Cai et al. - 2023 - Tetrahedral Framework Nucleic Acids Based Small In.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding LSNA trafficking is key to developing applications, but while much is understood about LSNA cell uptake, little is known about their export fate. Here, we study LSNA export through pulse-chase studies with fluorophore-labeled LSNAs. Our findings show that the components of LSNAs are differentially exported by cells, with the phospholipids showing 90–100% export and the oligonucleotides showing 30–45% export over 24 h in RAW264.7 macrophages. Despite the increase in the level of uptake of LSNAs, these percentages are not significantly influenced by whether the materials are taken up as LSNAs or as the individual components. The exported oligonucleotide material consists of a full-length oligonucleotide with the phospholipid anchor modified by loss of a fatty acid. The exported liposome-derived phospholipids also had a fatty acid removed. Moreover, the exported oligonucleotide-lysophospholipid conjugates retain immunostimulatory potential. These findings indicate that after cellular entry LSNAs are degraded into lysophospholipids, something to which they are susceptible due to the presence of hydrolyzable ester bonds. The export percentage of the resultant materials over 24 h is independent of the amount imported, such that greater initial import leads to a similar fold increase in exported material. This work therefore reveals an intracellular feature of LSNAs and shows that the enhanced uptake achieved with LSNAs can be exploited to maximize the amount of material subsequently exported, suggesting avenues for leveraging pharmacologic effects from exported LSNA components.","2023-10-10","2024-07-06 02:27:51","2024-07-06 02:28:17","2024-07-06 02:27:51","19000-19010","","19","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/MCWYL8CM/Paranandi et al. - 2023 - Cellular Export Fate of Liposomal Spherical Nuclei.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1)/p62, a vital selective autophagy receptor, recruits ubiquitinated cargo to form autophagosomes for lysosomal degradation. Nab-PTX is an albumin-bound paclitaxel nanoparticle used in clinical cancer therapy. However, the role of SQSTM1 in regulating the delivery and efficacy of nanodrugs remains unclear. Here we showed that SQSTM1 plays a crucial role in Nab-PTX drug delivery and efficacy in human lung and colorectal cancers. Nab-PTX induces SQSTM1 phosphorylation at Ser403, which facilitates its incorporation into the selective autophagy of nanoparticles, known as nanoparticulophagy. Nab-PTX increased LC3-II protein expression, which triggered autophagosome formation. SQSTM1 enhanced Nab-PTX recognition to form autophagosomes, which were delivered to lysosomes for albumin degradation, thereby releasing PTX to induce mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis. Knockout of SQSTM1 downregulated Nab-PTX-induced mitotic catastrophe, apoptosis, and tumor inhibition in vitro and in vivo and inhibited Nab-PTX-induced caspase 3 activation via a p53-independent pathway. Ectopic expression of SQSTM1 by transfection of an SQSTM1-GFP vector restored the drug efficacy of Nab-PTX. Importantly, SQSTM1 is highly expressed in advanced lung and colorectal tumors and is associated with poor overall survival in clinical patients.

The global TB situation is further complicated by increasing patient numbers infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb.) strains resistant to either one or two of the first-line therapeutics, promoted by insufficient treatment length and/or drug levels due to adverse reactions and reduced patient compliance. An intriguing approach to improve anti-TB therapy relates to nanocarrier-based drug-delivery systems, which enhance local drug concentrations at infection sites without systemic toxicity. Recently developed anti-TB antibiotics, however, are lipophilic and difficult to transport in aqueous systems. Here, the very lipophilic TB-antibiotics bedaquiline (BDQ) and BTZ (1,3-benzothiazin-4-one 043) are prepared as high-dose, amorphous nanoparticles via a solvent-antisolvent technique. The nanoparticles exhibit mean diameters of 60 ± 13 nm (BDQ) and 62 ± 44 nm (BTZ) and have an extraordinarily high drug load with 69% BDQ and >99% BTZ of total nanoparticle mass plus a certain amount of surfactant (31% for BDQ, <1% for BTZ) to make the lipophilic drugs water-dispersible. Suspensions with high drug load (4.1 mg/mL BDQ, 4.2 mg/mL BTZ) are stable for several weeks. In vitro and in vivo studies employing M.tb.-infected macrophages and susceptible C3HeB/FeJ mice show promising activity, which outperforms conventional BDQ/BTZ solutions (in DMF or DMSO) with an up to 50% higher efficacy upon pulmonary delivery.

In vivo, high amounts of the BDQ/BTZ nanoparticles are found in the lung and specifically inside granulomas, whereas only low BDQ/BTZ-nanoparticle levels are observed in spleen or liver.

However, the size (diameter) of the basic unit of the most existing ordered Nafion arrays, such as Nafion pillar or cone, is typically limited to micron or submicron sizes. Such small sizes only provide a limited number of proton transfer channels and a small specific area for catalyst loading. In this work, the ordered Nafion array with a pillar diameter of only 40 nm (D40) was successfully prepared through optimization of the Nafion solvent, thermal annealing temperature, and stripping mode from the anode alumina oxide (AAO) template. The density of D40 is 2.7 × 1010 pillars/cm2, providing an abundance of proton transfer channels. Additionally, D40 has a specific area of up to 51.5 cm2/cm2, which offers a large area for catalyst loading. This, in turn, results in the interface between the catalyst layer and gas diffusion layer becoming closer. Consequently, the peak power densities of the fuel cells are 1.47 (array as anode) and 1.29 W/cm2 (array as cathode), which are 3.3 and 2.9 times of that without array, respectively. The catalyst loading is significantly reduced to 17.6 (array as anode) and 61.0 μg/cm2 (array as cathode). Thus, the nanosized Nafion array has been proven to have high fuel cell performance with low Pt catalyst loading. Moreover, this study also provides guidance for the design of a catalyst layer for water electrolysis and electrosynthesis.","2023-05-23","2024-07-06 03:11:15","2024-07-06 03:11:48","2024-07-06 03:11:15","9487-9500","","10","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/SW4HR75W/Ning et al. - 2023 - Nanosized Proton Conductor Array with High Specifi.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If the translocation speed is too fast, the signatures of the bases passing through the sensing region of the nanopore overlap in time, presenting difficulties in accurately identifying the bases in a sequential manner. Even though several strategies, such as enzyme ratcheting, have been implemented to reduce the translocation speed, the challenge to achieve a substantial reduction in the translocation speed continues to be of paramount significance. Toward achieving this goal, we have fabricated a nonenzymatic hybrid device that can reduce the translocation speed of long DNAs by more than 2 orders of magnitude, in comparison with the current status of the art. This device is made of a tetra-PEG hydrogel that is chemically anchored to the donor side of a solid-state nanopore. The idea behind this device is based on the recent discovery of the topologically frustrated dynamical state of confined polymers, whereby the front hydrogel matter of the hybrid device provides multiple entropic traps for a single DNA molecule holding it back against the electrophoretic driving force that pulls the DNA through the solid-state nanopore portion of the device. As a demonstration of slowing DNA translocation by a factor of about 500, we find the average translocation time realized in the present hybrid device for 3 kbp DNA as 23.4 ms, whereas the corresponding time for the bare solid-state nanopore under otherwise identical conditions is 0.047 ms. Our measurements on 1 kbp DNA and λ-DNA show that such a slowing down of DNA translocation with our hybrid device is general. An additional feature of our hybrid device is its incorporation of all features of the conventional gel electrophoresis to separate different DNA sizes in a clump of DNAs and to streamline them in an orderly and slow manner into the nanopore. Our results suggest the high potential of our hydrogel-nanopore hybrid device in further advancing the single-molecule electrophoresis technology to accurately sequence very large biological polymers.","2023-05-23","2024-07-06 03:15:42","2024-07-06 03:15:54","2024-07-06 03:15:42","9197-9208","","10","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/F89DAWWD/Chen and Muthukumar - 2023 - Substantial Slowing of Electrophoretic Translocati.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A hybrid dry powder (HDP) strategy, characterized by decoupling of powder gelation and tissue adhesion, for rapid sealing of wet tissues is presented. HDPs carrying oppositely charged polyelectrolytes become a hydrogel layer over the target tissue by absorbing the surrounding water and forming strong electrostatic interactions between heterogeneous components. Strong adhesion is realized through hydrogen bonding between the adhesive component, poly(acrylic acid), and the tissue. Wet tissue adhesion can be achieved in a few seconds (adhesion strength of ∼30 kPa to porcine skin). Notably, the HDP-assembled hydrogel can maintain a low swelling rate and resist degradation in acidic aqueous environments (pH 1). Furthermore, HDPs can be delivered to target tissues by spraying via an endoscope. The results of in vivo experiments indicate that healing of gastric ESD perforations by sealing with the powder-assembled hydrogel is as effective as that by sealing with clips.

The importance of studying their physical stability lies primarily with their association with human neurodegenerative diseases, but also owing to their potential role in multiple bio-nanomaterial applications. Here, gold nanorods (AuNRs) were utilized to investigate the plasmonic heating properties and dissociation of amyloid-β fibrils formed by different peptide fragments (Aβ16–22/Aβ25–35/Aβ1–42) related to the Alzheimer’s disease. It is demonstrated that AuNRs were able to break mature amyloid-β fibrils from both the full length (Aβ1–42) and peptide fragments (Aβ16–22/Aβ25–35) within minutes by triggering ultrahigh localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) heating. The LSPR energy absorbed by the amyloids to unfold and move to higher levels in the protein folding energy landscape can be measured directly and in situ by luminescence thermometry using lanthanide-based upconverting nanoparticles. We also show that Aβ16–22 fibrils, with the largest persistence length, displayed the highest resistance to breakage, resulting in a transition from rigid fibrils to short flexible fibrils. These findings are consistent with molecular dynamics simulations indicating that Aβ16–22 fibrils possess the highest thermostability due to their highly ordered hydrogen bond networks and antiparallel β-sheet orientation, hence affected by an LSPR-induced remodeling rather than melting. The present results introduce original strategies for disassembling amyloid fibrils noninvasively in liquid environment; they also introduce a methodology to probe the positioning of amyloids on the protein folding and aggregation energy landscape via nanoparticle-enabled plasmonic and upconversion nanothermometry.","2023-05-23","2024-07-06 03:30:11","2024-07-06 03:30:33","2024-07-06 03:30:11","9429-9441","","10","17","","ACS Nano","Probing the Protein Folding Energy Landscape","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/LJFACBFV/Lin et al. - 2023 - Probing the Protein Folding Energy Landscape Diss.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, a methodology has been proposed to induce functional neuronal differentiation of BMSCs on a conductive three-dimensional graphene framework (GFs) combined with a rotating magnetic field. A wireless electrical signal of about 10 μA can be generated on the surface of GFs by cutting the magnetic field lines based on the well-known electromagnetic induction effect, which has been proven to be suitable for inducing neuronal differentiation of BMSCs. The enhanced expressions of the specific genes/proteins and apparent Ca2+ intracellular flow indicate that BMSCs cultured on GFs with 15 min/day rotating magnetic field stimulation for 15 days can differentiate functional neurons without any neural inducing factor. The animal experiments confirm the neural differentiation of BMSCs on GFs after transplantation in vivo, accompanied by stimulation of an external rotating magnetic field. This study overcomes the lack of autologous neural stem cells for adult neurodegeneration patients and provides a facile and safe strategy to induce the neural differentiation of BMSCs, which has potential for clinical applications of neural tissue engineering.","2023-08-22","2024-07-06 17:19:02","2024-07-06 17:19:14","2024-07-06 17:19:02","16204-16220","","16","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/3EWKKZF9/Gao et al. - 2023 - Wireless Electrical Signals Induce Functional Neur.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to the status or volumes of the tumors, the intensity and time of each therapeutic modality are optimized, and three modalities are combined programmatically and work in chronological order. The optimal synergistic therapy begins with high-intensity PTT for 10 min to ablate larger tumors, followed by medium-intensity CDT for several hours to eliminate medium-sized tumors, and then low-intensity coordinated dual drugs CT lasts over 48 h to clear smaller residual tumors. Composite nanoparticles, made of Fe-coordinated polydopamine mixed with copper peroxide as the cores and their surface dotted with lots of doxorubicin-Fe(III)-gossypol infinite coordination polymers (ICPs), have been developed to implement the strategy. These composite nanoparticles show excellent synergistic effects with the minimum dose of therapeutic agents and result in nearly 100% tumor inhibition for mice bearing PC-3 tumors and no observed recurrence within 60 days of treatment. The ratios of the different therapeutic agents in the composite nanoparticles can be adjusted to accommodate different types of tumors with this cost-effective programmed trimodal therapy strategy.","2023-07-11","2024-07-06 17:20:55","2024-07-06 17:21:19","2024-07-06 17:20:55","12544-12562","","13","17","","ACS Nano","Doxorubicin-Fe(III)-Gossypol Infinite Coordination Polymer@PDA","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/7SQ87W5I/Zhu et al. - 2023 - Doxorubicin-Fe(III)-Gossypol Infinite Coordination.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, its clinical application is largely hindered by tumor recurrence in the surviving rim and the potential risk of thromboembolic events due to nonspecific vasculature targeting. Herein, a neovasculature-targeting synthetic high-density lipoprotein (sHDL) nanodisc loaded with pyropheophorbide-a and camptothecin (CPN) was fabricated for photoactivatable tumor infarction and synergistic chemotherapy. By manipulating the anisotropy in ligand modification of sHDL nanodiscs, CPN modified with neovaculature-targeting peptide on the planes (PCPN) shows up to 7-fold higher cellular uptake compared with that around the edge (ECPN). PCPN can efficiently bind to endothelial cells of tumor vessels, and upon laser irradiation, massive local thrombus can be induced by the photodynamic reaction to deprive nutrition supply. Meanwhile, CPT could be released in response to the tumor reductive environment, thus killing residual tumor cells in the surviving rim to inhibit recurrence. These findings not only offer a powerful approach of synergistic cancer therapy but also suggest the potential of plane-modified sHDL nanodiscs as a versatile drug delivery nanocarrier.","2023-08-22","2024-07-06 17:24:15","2024-07-06 17:24:31","2024-07-06 17:24:15","16192-16203","","16","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/AI59SP82/Xu et al. - 2023 - Manipulating Neovasculature-Targeting Capability o.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typically, the DNA kirigami method enables the transformation of an origami structure from an initial shape to another predesigned shape by reconfiguring the staple strands. In a regular origami structure, since the perfectly matched and densely packed DNA duplexes block the removal of staple strands, the construction of finely trimmed “sub-origami” structures by the DNA kirigami method has remained challenging. Herein, we proposed a strategy to construct the presketched DNA origami canvas, where the offcut area in the canvas was sketched by loosely fixed staple strands with single-base insertion, to enhance the fineness of polymerase-driven DNA kirigami. We successfully trimmed presketched two-dimensional rectangular canvas, three-dimensional Möbius strip, and genie bottle canvases into complex letter patterns, supercoiled rings, and nanorods, respectively. Finally, we demonstrated a size-controlled DNA kirigami system: a presketched 6HB origami was trimmed into a set of shorter nanowires with predefined lengths, which quantitatively characterized the fineness of the improved DNA kirigami. The presketched origami design was a general method that applied to both 2D and 3D DNA origami structures in square and honeycomb lattices. Loosening DNA origami structures by introducing single-base insertions provides a practical approach to constructing dynamic components when designing DNA nanomachines. Furthermore, the delicate trimming of the DNA origami canvas driven by polymerase may inspire strategies for graphical information encryption and storage.","2023-09-12","2024-07-06 17:24:38","2024-07-06 17:24:55","2024-07-06 17:24:38","17265-17272","","17","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/8HDP7757/Chen et al. - 2023 - Presketched DNA Origami Canvas for Polymerase-Driv.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we found that photoinduced inflammation response caused the migration of neutrophils into tumor microenvironments and neutrophils transported neutrophil-targeted nanoparticles (NPs) across the tumor blood barrier. The results showed that tumor delivery efficiencies of NPs were 5% ID/g, and they were independent of particle sizes (30–200 nm) and their doses (108–1011 NPs). To efficiently deliver anticancer agents into tumors via neutrophils, we fabricated carrier-free paclitaxel nanocrystals (PTX NC). The results showed that neutrophil uptake of PTX NC did not impair neutrophil tumor infiltration, and the sustainable release of PTX from PTX NC in tumors was regulated by paclitaxel protein complexes, thus improving the mouse survival in two preclinical models. Our studies demonstrate that delivery of nanocrystal drugs via neutrophils is a promising method to effectively treat a wide range of cancers, and we have also identified a mechanism of drug release from neutrophils in tumors.","2023-08-22","2024-07-06 17:25:03","2024-07-06 17:25:21","2024-07-06 17:25:03","15542-15555","","16","17","","ACS Nano","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACS Publications","","Publisher: American Chemical Society","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/MJTKE3N5/Su et al. - 2023 - Neutrophil-Mediated Delivery of Nanocrystal Drugs .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
