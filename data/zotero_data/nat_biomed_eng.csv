Here we report an LNP-screening method for the optimization of the type of helper lipid and of lipid-component ratios to enhance the delivery of tumour-antigen-encoding mRNA to dendritic cells and their immune-activation profile towards enhanced antitumour activity. The method involves screening for LNPs that enhance the maturation of bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells and antigen presentation in vitro, followed by assessing immune activation and tumour-growth suppression in a mouse model of melanoma after subcutaneous or intramuscular delivery of the LNPs. We found that the most potent antitumour activity, especially when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors, resulted from a coordinated attack by T cells and NK cells, triggered by LNPs that elicited strong immune activity in both type-1 and type-2 T helper cells. Our findings highlight the importance of optimizing the LNP composition of mRNA-based cancer vaccines to tailor antigen-specific immune-activation profiles.","2023-12-11","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2023-12-16 02:02:50","1-17","","","","","Nat.

Specifically, we leveraged the expertise of dermatologists for the clinical task of differentiating melanomas from melanoma ‘lookalikes’ on the basis of dermoscopic and clinical images of the skin, and the power of generative models to render ‘counterfactual’ images to understand the ‘reasoning’ processes of five medical-image classifiers. By altering image attributes to produce analogous images that elicit a different prediction by the classifiers, and by asking physicians to identify medically meaningful features in the images, the counterfactual images revealed that the classifiers rely both on features used by human dermatologists, such as lesional pigmentation patterns, and on undesirable features, such as background skin texture and colour balance. The framework can be applied to any specialized medical domain to make the powerful inference processes of machine-learning models medically understandable.","2023-12-28","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-05-27 00:47:12","1-13","","","","","Nat.

We analysed the mechanisms of T-cell-mediated damage of neoplastic and donor-matched healthy epithelia at a single-cell resolution using multiplexed immunofluorescence. We found that TCBs that target the epithelial cell-adhesion molecule led to apoptosis in healthy organoids in accordance with clinical observations, and that apoptosis is associated with T-cell activation, cytokine release and intra-epithelial T-cell infiltration. Conversely, tumour organoids were more resistant to damage, probably owing to a reduced efficiency of T-cell infiltration within the epithelium.

Here we show that the lower-dimensional nonlinear latent factors and latent structures can be computationally modelled in a manner that allows for flexible inference causally, non-causally and in the presence of missing neural observations. To enable flexible inference, we developed a neural network that separates the model into jointly trained manifold and dynamic latent factors such that nonlinearity is captured through the manifold factors and the dynamics can be modelled in tractable linear form on this nonlinear manifold. We show that the model, which we named ‘DFINE’ (for ‘dynamical flexible inference for nonlinear embeddings’) achieves flexible inference in simulations of nonlinear dynamics and across neural datasets representing a diversity of brain regions and behaviours. Compared with earlier neural-network models, DFINE enables flexible inference, better predicts neural activity and behaviour, and better captures the latent neural manifold structure.

This transition to instability can be described by the critical threshold for a dimensionless number that depends on blood pressure, the size of the aorta, and the shear stress and stiffness of the aortic wall. By analysing data from four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging for 117 patients who had undergone cardiothoracic imaging and for 100 healthy volunteers, we show that the dimensionless number is a physiomarker for the growth of thoracic ascending aortic aneurysms and that it can be used to accurately discriminate abnormal versus natural growth.

We used state-of-the-art linear and nonlinear families of models to describe spontaneous resting-state activity of 700 participants in the Human Connectome Project and 122 participants in the Restoring Active Memory project. We found that linear autoregressive models provide the best fit across both data types and three performance metrics: predictive power, computational complexity and the extent of the residual dynamics unexplained by the model. To explain this observation, we show that microscopic nonlinear dynamics can be counteracted or masked by four factors associated with macroscopic dynamics: averaging over space and over time, which are inherent to aggregated macroscopic brain activity, and observation noise and limited data samples, which stem from technological limitations. We therefore argue that easier-to-interpret linear models can faithfully describe macroscopic brain dynamics during resting-state conditions.","2024-01","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-05-27 00:47:14","68-84","","1","8","","Nat.

Here we show that antigen-restricted mature T cells can be generated in vitro from PSCs edited via CRISPR to lack endogenous T cell receptors (TCRs) and class I major histocompatibility complexes. Specifically, we used T cell precursors from RAG1−/−RAG2−/−B2M−/− human PSCs expressing a single TCR, and a murine stromal cell line providing the cognate human major histocompatibility complex molecule and other critical signals for T cell maturation. Possibly owing to the absence of TCR mispairing, the generated T cells showed substantially better tumour control in mice than T cells with an intact endogenous TCR.

The formulation consists of gluconic acid-modified recombinant human insulin binding tightly to poly-l-lysine modified by 4-carboxy-3-fluorophenylboronic acid via glucose-responsive phenylboronic acid–diol complexation and electrostatic attraction. When the insulin complex is exposed to high glucose concentrations, the phenylboronic acid moieties of the polymers bind rapidly to glucose, breaking the complexation and reducing the polymers’ positive charge density, which promotes the release of insulin.

The neovascularized cavity led to the sustained reversal of diabetes, as we show in immunocompetent syngeneic, allogeneic and xenogeneic mouse models of diabetes, owing to increased oxygenation, physiological glucose responsiveness and islet survival, as indicated by a computational model of mass transport. The cavity also allowed for the in situ replacement of impaired devices, with prompt return to normoglycemia.

Here we describe multi-pass high-dimensional flow cytometry, a method leveraging cellular barcoding via microparticles emitting near-infrared laser light to track and repeatedly measure each cell using more markers and fewer colours. By using live human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we show that the method enables the time-resolved characterization of the same cells before and after stimulation, their analysis via a 10-marker panel with minimal compensation for spectral spillover and their deep immunophenotyping via a 32-marker panel, where the same cells are analysed in 3 back-to-back cycles with 10–13 markers per cycle, reducing overall spillover and simplifying marker-panel design.

Cytokine receptor signalling pathways in CAR T cells can be activated by transgenic expression or injection of cytokines in the tumour, or by engineering the activation of cognate cytokine receptors. However, these strategies are constrained by toxicity arising from the activation of bystander cells, by the suboptimal biodistribution of the cytokines and by downregulation of the cognate receptor. Here we show that replacement of the extracellular domains of heterodimeric cytokine receptors in T cells with two leucine zipper motifs provides optimal Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signalling. Such chimeric cytokine receptors, which can be generated for common γ-chain receptors, interleukin-10 and -12 receptors, enabled T cells to survive cytokine starvation without induction of autonomous cell growth, and augmented the effector function of CAR T cells in vitro in the setting of chronic antigen exposure and in human tumour xenografts in mice. As a modular design, leucine zippers can be used to generate constitutively active cytokine receptors in effector immune cells.","2024-04","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-05-27 00:47:15","380-396","","4","8","","Nat.

Mechanistically, a metabolic shift towards anaerobic glycolysis disrupts the redox balance of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), resulting in increased global protein acetylation (and in particular the acetylation of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase), a molecular signature of heart failure. Restoration of NAD redox by NAD+ supplementation reduced sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase acetylation and accelerated the functional recovery of the engineered heart tissue after tachycardia.

Traction forces of tens of piconewtons trigger the dehybridization of the duplex, exposing a cryptic Cas12-activating strand that sets off the indiscriminate Cas12-mediated cleavage of a fluorogenic reporter strand.

For seven patients who had undergone cardiopulmonary bypass, platelet dysfunction strongly correlated with the need for platelet transfusion to limit bleeding.

Different from its known cis/trans RNA-cleavage activity, Cas13 can also cleave host RNA via mechanisms that are transcript-specific, independent of the sequence of CRISPR RNA and dynamically dependent on the conformational state of Cas13, as we show for several Cas13-family effectors encoded in one-vector and two-vector lentiviral systems. Moreover, host genes involved in viral processes and whose transcripts are intrinsically targeted by Cas13 contribute to constraining the lentiviral delivery and expression of Cas13.

This tumour-specific shift in FLT can be used to distinguish tumours from normal tissue with an accuracy of over 97% across tumour types, and can be visualized at the cellular level using microscopy and in larger specimens through wide-field imaging.

The model classified the haemodynamic states on the basis of an unseen subset of sensor data for 10 healthy individuals, 20 patients with hypertension undergoing haemodynamic stimuli and 15 patients recovering from cardiac surgery, with an average precision of 0.878 and an overall area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.958. The multinodal sensor system may provide clinically actionable insights into haemodynamic states for use in the management of cardiovascular disease.","2023-10","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-05-27 00:47:18","1229-1241","","10","7","","Nat.

FBRs to such elevated extrinsic forces in the mice were also mediated by the activation of Rac2 signalling in a subpopulation of mechanoresponsive myeloid cells, which could be substantially reduced via the pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Rac2.

We show that pGal–antigen therapy induces antigen-specific tolerance in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (with programmed cell-death-1 and the co-inhibitory ligand CD276 driving the tolerogenic responses), as well as the suppression of antigen-specific responses to vaccination against a DNA-based simian immunodeficiency virus in non-human primates.

This microphysiological system revealed 1 Hz cardiac respiratory cycles that are coupled to the electrical rather than the mechanical activity of cardiomyocytes. This electro-mitochondrial coupling was driven by mitochondrial calcium oscillations driving respiration cycles.

In mice with xenografted decellularized physiological bone matrices seeded with human breast tumour cells, the presence of bone mineral reduced tumour growth and upregulated a gene-expression signature that is associated with longer metastasis-free survival in patients with breast cancer.

The osmotic pressure of the electroporation buffer dampened cGAS–DNA interactions, affecting the production of the STING activator 2′3′-cGAMP. The buffer also led to superior efficiencies in the transfection of therapeutically relevant primary T cells and human haematopoietic stem cells.

Here we describe an image reconstruction method for the simultaneous in vivo imaging of two PET tracers and thereby the independent quantification of two molecular signals. This method of multiplexed PET imaging leverages the 350–700 keV range to maximize the capture of 511 keV annihilation photons and prompt γ-ray emission in the same energy window, hence eliminating the need for energy discrimination during reconstruction or for signal separation beforehand. We used multiplexed PET to track, in mice with subcutaneous tumours, the biodistributions of intravenously injected [124I]I-trametinib and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose, [124I]I-trametinib and its nanoparticle carrier [89Zr]Zr-ferumoxytol, and the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and infused PSMA-targeted chimaeric antigen receptor T cells after the systemic administration of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and [124I]I.

Yet it is becoming clearer that the phenotypes and functions of T cells are inherently linked to their localization in tissues. Here we show that functionally distinct T-cell populations can be generated from T cells that received the same stimulation by altering the viscoelasticity of their surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). By using a model ECM based on a norbornene-modified collagen type I whose viscoelasticity can be adjusted independently from its bulk stiffness by varying the degree of covalent crosslinking via a bioorthogonal click reaction with tetrazine moieties, we show that ECM viscoelasticity regulates T-cell phenotype and function via the activator-protein-1 signalling pathway, a critical regulator of T-cell activation and fate. Our observations are consistent with the tissue-dependent gene-expression profiles of T cells isolated from mechanically distinct tissues from patients with cancer or fibrosis, and suggest that matrix viscoelasticity could be leveraged when generating T-cell products for therapeutic applications.","2023-11","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-05-27 00:49:14","1374-1391","","11","7","","Nat.

Direct exposure of the BBB chip to SARS-CoV-2 caused mild changes to the BBB, and infusion of medium from the infected alveolus chip led to more severe injuries on the BBB chip, including endothelial dysfunction, pericyte detachment and neuroinflammation. Transcriptomic analyses indicated downregulated expression of the actin cytoskeleton in brain endothelium and upregulated expression of inflammatory genes in glial cells. We also observed early cerebral microvascular damage following lung infection with a low viral load in the brains of transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.

To take advantage of this paradoxical IL4 feature in vivo, we developed a fusion protein of apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) and IL4, which integrates into a lipid nanoparticle. In mice and non-human primates, an intravenously injected apoA1-IL4-embedding nanoparticle targets myeloid-cell-rich haematopoietic organs, in particular, the spleen and bone marrow.

We show the utility of REMEDIS in a range of diagnostic-imaging tasks covering six imaging domains and 15 test datasets, and by simulating three realistic out-of-distribution scenarios. REMEDIS improved in-distribution diagnostic accuracies up to 11.5% with respect to strong supervised baseline models, and in out-of-distribution settings required only 1–33% of the data for retraining to match the performance of supervised models retrained using all available data.

We used INSPECTR to detect a panel of five respiratory viral targets in a single reaction via a lateral-flow readout and ~4,000 copies of viral RNA via additional ambient-temperature rolling circle amplification of the expression cassette.

Here, we describe a high-throughput and accurate method for the screening of pooled nanoparticle formulations within the same animal. The method uses liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry to detect peptide barcodes translated from mRNAs in nanoparticle-transfected cells. We show the method’s applicability by evaluating a library of over 400 nanoparticle formulations with 384 unique ionizable lipids using only nine mice to optimize the formulation of a biodegradable lipid nanoparticle for mRNA delivery to the liver.

Here we report a method for the knock-in and stable expression of a large payload and for the simultaneous knock-in of two genes at two endogenous loci. The method, which we named CLIP (for ‘CRISPR for long-fragment integration via pseudovirus’), leverages an integrase-deficient lentivirus encoding a payload flanked by homology arms and ‘cut sites’ to insert the payload upstream and in-frame of an endogenous essential gene, followed by the delivery of a CRISPR-associated ribonucleoprotein complex via electroporation.

Deuterium MRSI (2H-MRSI) is a non-invasive and safe alternative for the quantification of the metabolism of 2H-labelled substrates such as glucose and their downstream metabolic products, yet it can only measure a limited number of deuterated compounds and requires specialized hardware. Here we show that proton MRSI (1H-MRSI) at 7 T has higher sensitivity, chemical specificity and spatiotemporal resolution than 2H-MRSI. We used 1H-MRSI in five volunteers to differentiate glutamate, glutamine, γ-aminobutyric acid and glucose deuterated at specific molecular positions, and to simultaneously map deuterated and non-deuterated metabolites. 1H-MRSI, which is amenable to clinically available magnetic-resonance hardware, may facilitate the study of glucose metabolism in the brain and its potential roles in neurological disorders.","2023-08","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-05-27 00:49:14","1001-1013","","8","7","","Nat.

Seventeen weeks after transplantation into immunodeficient mice, prime-edited SCD HSPCs maintained HBBA levels and displayed engraftment frequencies, haematopoietic differentiation and lineage maturation similar to those of unedited HSPCs from healthy donors. An average of 42% of human erythroblasts and reticulocytes isolated 17 weeks after transplantation of prime-edited HSPCs from four SCD patient donors expressed HBBA, exceeding the levels predicted for therapeutic benefit.

Here we show that the genome-editing activity of Cas9 can be constrained by the addition of cytosine stretches to the 5′-end of conventional single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Such a ‘safeguard sgRNA’ strategy, which is compatible with Cas12a and with systems for gene activation and interference via CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), leads to the length-dependent inhibition of the formation of functional Cas9 complexes. Short cytosine extensions reduced p53 activation and cytotoxicity in human pluripotent stem cells, and enhanced homology-directed repair while maintaining bi-allelic editing. Longer extensions further decreased on-target activity yet improved the specificity and precision of mono-allelic editing. By monitoring indels through a fluorescence-based allele-specific system and computational simulations, we identified optimal windows of Cas9 activity for a number of genome-editing applications, including bi-allelic and mono-allelic editing, and the generation and correction of disease-associated single-nucleotide substitutions via homology-directed repair.

Physical phenotype parameters extracted from brightfield images of single cells distinguished cell subpopulations in various tissues, enhancing or even substituting measurements of molecular markers.

Here we show that laryngeal lesions can be better detected in real time by taking advantage of differences in the light-polarization properties of cancer and healthy tissues. By measuring differences in polarized-light retardance and depolarization, the technique, which we named ‘surgical polarimetric endoscopy’ (SPE), generates about one-order-of-magnitude greater contrast than white-light endoscopy, and hence allows for the better discrimination of cancerous lesions, as we show with patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma. Polarimetric imaging of excised and stained slices of laryngeal tissue indicated that changes in the retardance of polarized light can be largely attributed to architectural features of the tissue. We also assessed SPE to aid routine transoral laser surgery for the removal of a cancerous lesion, indicating that SPE can complement white-light endoscopy for the detection of laryngeal cancer.","2023-08","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-05-27 00:49:15","971-985","","8","7","","Nat.

Here we show that the zwitterionic heptamethine fluorophore ZW800-1C, which has peak excitation and emission wavelengths in the near-infrared optical window, binds in vivo and at high contrast to amyloid-β deposits and to neurofibrillary tangles, and allows for the microscopic imaging of amyloid-β and tau aggregates through the intact skull of mice. In transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, we compare the performance of ZW800-1C with that of the two spectrally similar heptamethine fluorophores ZW800-1A and indocyanine green, and show that ZW800-1C undergoes a longer fluorescence-lifetime shift when bound to amyloid-β and tau aggregates than when circulating in blood vessels. ZW800-1C may prove advantageous for tracking the proteinic aggregates in rodent models of amyloid-β and tau pathologies.","2023-03","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-05-27 00:49:31","270-280","","3","7","","Nat.

Here we show that plasmonically active antibody-conjugated fluorescent gold nanorods can make conventional LFAs ultrasensitive. With sample-to-answer times within 20 min, plasmonically enhanced LFAs read out via a standard benchtop fluorescence scanner attained about 30-fold improvements in dynamic range and in detection limits over 4-h-long gold-standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and achieved 95% clinical sensitivity and 100% specificity for antibodies in plasma and for antigens in nasopharyngeal swabs from individuals with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Comparable improvements in the assay’s performance can also be achieved via an inexpensive portable scanner, as we show for the detection of interleukin-6 in human serum samples and of the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples. Plasmonically enhanced LFAs outperform standard laboratory tests in sensitivity, speed, dynamic range, ease of use and cost, and may provide advantages in point-of-care diagnostics.","2023-12","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-05-27 00:49:31","1556-1570","","12","7","","Nat.

Here we report the impact of the structural presentation of two antigenic peptides on immune responses at the transcriptomic, cellular and organismal levels. We used spherical nucleic acid (SNA) nanoparticles to investigate how the spatial distribution and placement of two antigen classes affect antigen processing, cytokine production and the induction of memory. Compared with single-antigen SNAs, a single dual-antigen SNA elicited a 30% increase in antigen-specific T cell activation and a two-fold increase in T cell proliferation. Antigen placement within dual-antigen SNAs altered the gene expression of T cells and tumour growth. Specifically, dual-antigen SNAs encapsulating antigens targeting helper T cells and with externally conjugated antigens targeting cytotoxic T cells elevated antitumour genetic pathways, stalling lymphoma tumours in mice. Additionally, when combined with the checkpoint inhibitor anti-programmed-cell-death protein-1 in a mouse model of melanoma, a specific antigen arrangement within dual-antigen SNAs suppressed tumour growth and increased the levels of circulating memory T cells. The structural design of multi-antigen vaccines substantially impacts their efficacy.","2023-07","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-05-27 00:49:31","911-927","","7","7","","Nat.

Moreover, the discovery and profiling of blood biomarkers in clinical and research settings are constrained by geographical barriers, the cost and inconvenience of in-clinic venepuncture, low sampling frequency and the low depth of molecular measurements. Here we describe a strategy for the frequent capture and analysis of thousands of metabolites, lipids, cytokines and proteins in 10 μl of blood alongside physiological information from wearable sensors. We show the advantages of such frequent and dense multi-omics microsampling in two applications: the assessment of the reactions to a complex mixture of dietary interventions, to discover individualized inflammatory and metabolic responses; and deep individualized profiling, to reveal large-scale molecular fluctuations as well as thousands of molecular relationships associated with intra-day physiological variations (in heart rate, for example) and with the levels of clinical biomarkers (specifically, glucose and cortisol) and of physical activity. Combining wearables and multi-omics microsampling for frequent and scalable omics may facilitate dynamic health profiling and biomarker discovery.","2024-01","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-05-27 00:49:31","11-29","","1","8","","Nat.

We also show that the intradermal delivery of the mRNA-loaded EVs via a microneedle array led to the prolonged and more uniform synthesis and replacement of collagen in the dermis of the animals. The intradermal delivery of EV-based COL1A1 mRNA may make for an effective protein-replacement therapy for the treatment of photoaged skin.","2023-07","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-05-27 00:49:32","887-900","","7","7","","Nat.

Here we report a machine-learning pipeline that mines the hundreds of billions of sequences in the entire virtual library of peptides made of 6–9 amino acids to identify potent antimicrobial peptides. The pipeline consists of trainable machine-learning modules (for performing empirical selection, classification, ranking and regression tasks) assembled sequentially following a coarse-to-fine design principle to gradually narrow down the search space. The leading three antimicrobial hexapeptides identified by the pipeline showed strong activities against a wide range of clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant pathogens. In mice with bacterial pneumonia, aerosolized formulations of the identified peptides showed therapeutic efficacy comparable to penicillin, negligible toxicity and a low propensity to induce drug resistance. The machine-learning pipeline may accelerate the discovery of new functional peptides.","2023-06","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-06-11 05:50:13","2024-05-27 00:49:32","797-810","","6","7","","Nat.
