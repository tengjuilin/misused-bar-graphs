Despite their importance as drug targets, the molecular origins of pharmacological properties such as efficacy (maximum signaling response) and potency (the ligand concentration at half-maximal response) remain poorly understood for any ligand-receptor-signaling system. We used the prototypical adrenaline–β2 adrenergic receptor–G protein system to reveal how specific receptor residues decode and translate the information encoded in a ligand to mediate a signaling response. We present a data science framework to integrate pharmacological and structural data to uncover structural changes and allosteric networks relevant for ligand pharmacology. These methods can be tailored to study any ligand-receptor-signaling system, and the principles open possibilities for designing orthosteric and allosteric compounds with defined signaling properties.","2023-12-22","2024-07-04 21:41:52","2024-07-04 21:51:34","2024-07-04 21:41:52","eadh1859","","6677","382","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/I634TDJQ/Heydenreich et al. - 2023 - Molecular determinants of ligand efficacy and pote.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present cryo–electron microscopy structures of Rab29–LRRK2 complexes in three oligomeric states, providing key snapshots during LRRK2 recruitment and activation. Rab29 induces an unexpected tetrameric assembly of LRRK2, formed by two kinase-active central protomers and two kinase-inactive peripheral protomers.

Blocking exocytosis impairs aversive learning, whereas activation of EG can replace aversive stimuli during conditioning. Glutamate released from EG binds to N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors in the MBs, but because of Mg2+ block, Ca2+ influx occurs only when flies are simultaneously exposed to an odor.

In E3.5 inner cell mass (ICM), SOX2 regulates the ICM-trophectoderm program but is dispensable for opening global enhancers. Instead, SOX2 occupies preaccessible enhancers in part opened by early-stage expressing TFs TFAP2C and NR5A2.

Moreover, this community-level resistance rested critically upon certain species being present. We explained these ecological patterns through the collective ability of resistant communities to consume nutrients that overlap with those used by the pathogen.

Low cytotoxic capacity was attributable to impaired degranulation in response to the low antigen levels present on HIV-infected targets. The vaccine-induced T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire was polyclonal and transduction of these TCRs conferred the same reduced functions.

Light activation of HcKCR2 in Arabidopsis guard cells evokes a transient cytoplasmic acidification that sparks Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum.

We show experimentally that honeyguides in Tanzania and Mozambique discriminate among honey hunters’ calls, responding more readily to local than to foreign calls.

Instead, c-Maf commands a tissue-resident program in TRM17 cells parallel to that induced by Hobit in TRM1 cells, with an ICOS–c-Maf–IL-7 axis pivotal to TRM17 cell commitment. Accordingly, by targeting this pathway, skin TRM17 cells can be ablated without compromising their TRM1 counterparts.

Under physiological conditions, SLC25A39 is rapidly degraded by mitochondrial protease AFG3L2. Depletion of GSH dissociates AFG3L2 from SLC25A39, causing a compensatory increase in mitochondrial GSH uptake.

Becoming a parent also requires behavioral adaptations. Such adaptations can occur as early as during pregnancy, but how pregnancy hormones remodel parenting circuits to instruct preparatory behavioral changes remains unknown. We found that action of estradiol and progesterone on galanin (Gal)–expressing neurons in the mouse medial preoptic area (MPOA) is critical for pregnancy-induced parental behavior. Whereas estradiol silences MPOAGal neurons and paradoxically increases their excitability, progesterone permanently rewires this circuit node by promoting dendritic spine formation and recruitment of excitatory synaptic inputs. This MPOAGal-specific neural remodeling sparsens population activity in vivo and results in persistently stronger, more selective responses to pup stimuli. Pregnancy hormones thus remodel parenting circuits in anticipation of future behavioral need.","2023-10-06","2024-07-05 07:04:44","2024-07-05 21:01:29","2024-07-05 07:04:44","76-81","","6666","382","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/PN255R9U/Ammari et al. - 2023 - Hormone-mediated neural remodeling orchestrates pa.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we report that DONSON, a metazoan protein mutated in microcephalic primordial dwarfism, is required for CMG assembly in vertebrates. Using AlphaFold to screen for protein-protein interactions followed by experimental validation, we show that DONSON scaffolds a vertebrate pre-LC containing GINS, TOPBP1, and DNA pol ε. Our evidence suggests that DONSON docks the pre-LC onto MCM2-7, delivering GINS to its binding site in CMG.

However, IRE1α was selectively reactivated in an ER stress–independent manner in acquired KRASi-resistant tumors, restoring proteostasis. Oncogenic KRAS promoted IRE1α protein stability through extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)–dependent phosphorylation of IRE1α, leading to IRE1α disassociation from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl reductase degradation (HRD1) E3-ligase. In KRASi-resistant tumors, both reactivated ERK and hyperactivated AKT restored IRE1α phosphorylation and stability. Suppression of IRE1α overcame resistance to KRASi.

We found that tPA, partially through the lysine-binding site on its Kringle 2 domain, binds to the N terminus of apoB, blocking the interaction between apoB and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) in hepatocytes, thereby reducing very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly and plasma apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) sequesters tPA away from apoB and increases VLDL assembly. Humans with PAI-1 deficiency have smaller VLDL particles and lower plasma levels of apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol. These results suggest a mechanism that fine-tunes VLDL assembly by intracellular interactions among tPA, PAI-1, and apoB in hepatocytes.","2023-09","2024-07-05 07:08:00","2024-07-05 21:12:53","2024-07-05 07:08:00","eadh5207","","6661","381","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ZTDRFZAK/Dai et al. - 2023 - Intracellular tPA–PAI-1 interaction determines VLD.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aging down-regulates microRNA 145 (miR-145) and derepresses the neurorepulsive factor semaphorin-3A. miR-145 deletion, which increased Sema3a expression or endothelial Sema3a overexpression, reduced axon density, mimicking the aged-heart phenotype.

What precludes the DDR machinery from accessing the telomeric double-stranded–single-stranded junction is unknown. We demonstrate that human POT1 binds this junction by recognizing the phosphorylated 5′ end of the chromosome. High-resolution crystallographic structures reveal that the junction is capped by POT1 through a “POT-hole” surface, the mutation of which compromises junction protection in vitro and telomeric 5′-end definition and DDR suppression in human cells. Whereas both mouse POT1 paralogs bind the single-stranded overhang, POT1a, not POT1b, contains a POT-hole and binds the junction, which explains POT1a’s sufficiency for end protection. Our study shifts the paradigm for DDR suppression at telomeres by highlighting the importance of protecting the double-stranded–single-stranded junction.","2023-08-18","2024-07-05 20:40:08","2024-07-05 21:15:07","2024-07-05 20:40:08","771-778","","6659","381","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ZS4I8DB4/Tesmer et al. - 2023 - Human POT1 protects the telomeric ds-ss DNA juncti.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about the interactive effects of rising Ca and climate change on WUEeco. On the basis of upscaled estimates from machine learning methods and global FLUXNET observations, we show that global WUEeco has not risen since 2001 because of the asymmetric effects of an increased vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which depressed photosynthesis and enhanced ET. An undiminished ET trend indicates that rising temperature and VPD may play a more important role in regulating ET than declining stomatal conductance.

In this work, we find that direct interactions between the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of both the γc and the interleukin receptors (ILRs) are also required for receptor activation. Moreover, the same γc TMD can specifically recognize multiple ILR TMDs of diverse sequences within the family. Heterodimer structures of γc TMD bound to IL-7 and IL-9 receptor TMDs—determined in a lipid bilayer–like environment by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy—reveal a conserved knob-into-hole mechanism of recognition that mediates receptor sharing within the membrane.

We used simulations to show that such strong repulsion can only occur if CNDD considerably exceeds heterospecific negative density dependence—an even stronger condition required for coexistence—and that large-scale repulsion can indeed result from small-scale CNDD.

Among them, TRIM11 was markedly down-regulated in AD brains. TRIM11 promoted the proteasomal degradation of mutant tau as well as superfluous normal tau.

Intracranial delivery of TRIM11 through adeno-associated viruses ameliorated pathology, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairments in multiple animal models of tauopathies.

To determine the outcomes of these experiments, we developed an automated image analysis pipeline to quantify species abundances.

In this work, we report that most enhancers in Drosophila can be repressed by only a subset of CoRs, and enhancers classified by CoR sensitivity show distinct chromatin features, function, TF motifs, and binding. Distinct TF motifs render enhancers more resistant or sensitive to specific CoRs, as we demonstrate by motif mutagenesis and addition.

While studying the evolutionary origin of a selfish element in the nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae, we discovered that Mavericks, ancient virus-like transposons related to giant viruses and virophages, are one of the long-sought vectors of horizontal gene transfer. We found that Mavericks gained a novel herpesvirus-like fusogen in nematodes, leading to the widespread exchange of cargo genes between extremely divergent species, bypassing sexual and genetic barriers spanning hundreds of millions of years. Our results show how the union between viruses and transposons causes horizontal gene transfer and ultimately genetic incompatibilities in natural populations.","2023-06-30","2024-07-06 05:56:36","2024-07-06 06:01:26","2024-07-06 05:56:36","eade0705","","6652","380","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ZJMX7CD4/Widen et al. - 2023 - Virus-like transposons cross the species barrier a.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tundra diversity declined regardless of experimental treatment, as background growing season temperatures rose with sea ice loss. However, diversity declined slower with large herbivores than without them.

Shark-dominated assemblages persist in wealthy nations with strong governance and in highly protected areas, whereas poverty, weak governance, and a lack of shark management are associated with depauperate assemblages mainly composed of rays.

A reversal of this decline through taurine supplementation increased the health span (the period of healthy living) and life span in mice and health span in monkeys. Mechanistically, taurine reduced cellular senescence, protected against telomerase deficiency, suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased DNA damage, and attenuated inflammaging. In humans, lower taurine concentrations correlated with several age-related diseases and taurine concentrations increased after acute endurance exercise. Thus, taurine deficiency may be a driver of aging because its reversal increases health span in worms, rodents, and primates and life span in worms and rodents.

These deleterious ABX effects were mimicked by oral gavage of Enterocloster species, by genetic deficiency, or by antibody-mediated neutralization of MAdCAM-1 and its receptor, α4β7 integrin. By contrast, fecal microbiota transplantation or interleukin-17A neutralization prevented ABX-induced immunosuppression.

Here, using super-resolution microscopy, we found that the two essential subcomplexes of the proteasome, the regulatory (19S) and catalytic (20S) particles, are differentially distributed within individual rat cortical neurons. We discovered an unexpected abundance of free 19S particles near synapses. The free neuronal 19S particles bind and deubiquitylate lysine 63–ubiquitin (Lys63-ub), a non–proteasome-targeting ubiquitin linkage.

TCR activation triggers membrane specialization within the immune synapse, including the production of diacylglycerol (DAG), a lipid that can induce negative membrane curvature. We found that activated TCRs were shed into DAG-enriched ectosomes at the immune synapse rather than internalized through endocytosis, suggesting that DAG may contribute to the outward budding required for ectocytosis. Budding ectosomes were endocytosed directly by target cells, thereby terminating TCR signaling and simultaneously disengaging the CTL from the target cell to allow serial killing.

Combining video microscopy and mathematical modeling, we discovered that this reorganization is mediated by “smart reversals” wherein gliding filaments reverse when their overlap with other filaments diminishes. By regulating smart reversals, filaments control aggregate architecture without central coordination.

We find that hunger modulates aging in Drosophila. Limitation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) or activation of hunger-promoting neurons induced a hunger state that extended life span despite increased feeding. Alteration of the neuronal histone acetylome was associated with BCAA limitation, and preventing these alterations abrogated the effect of BCAA limitation to increase feeding and extend life span. Hunger acutely increased feeding through usage of the histone variant H3.3, whereas prolonged hunger seemed to decrease a hunger set point, resulting in beneficial consequences for aging. Demonstration of the sufficiency of hunger to extend life span reveals that motivational states alone can be deterministic drivers of aging.","2023-05-12","2024-07-06 06:14:04","2024-07-06 06:17:01","2024-07-06 06:14:04","625-632","","6645","380","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/H4YMEZEP/Weaver et al. - 2023 - Effects of hunger on neuronal histone modification.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We identified the olfactory receptor that detects phenylacetonitrile and used genome editing to make this receptor nonfunctional, thereby abolishing the negative behavioral response. We also inactivated the gene underlying phenylacetonitrile production and show that locusts that lack this compound lose its protection and are more frequently exposed to intraspecific predation.

However, our understanding of the underlying communication frameworks remains rudimentary. Here, we show that nociceptors control DCs in three molecularly distinct ways. First, nociceptors release the calcitonin gene–related peptide that imparts a distinct transcriptional profile on steady-state DCs characterized by expression of pro–interleukin-1β and other genes implicated in DC sentinel functions. Second, nociceptor activation induces contact-dependent calcium fluxes and membrane depolarization in DCs and enhances their production of proinflammatory cytokines when stimulated. Finally, nociceptor-derived chemokine CCL2 contributes to the orchestration of DC-dependent local inflammation and the induction of adaptive responses against skin-acquired antigens. Thus, the combined actions of nociceptor-derived chemokines, neuropeptides, and electrical activity fine-tune DC responses in barrier tissues.","2023-03-31","2024-07-06 07:13:46","2024-07-06 16:38:51","2024-07-06 07:13:46","eabm5658","","6639","379","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/H9TULBEF/Hanč et al. - 2023 - Multimodal control of dendritic cell functions by .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present a large-scale analysis of evolutionary transitions in amphibian antipredation coloration and demonstrate that the evolutionary transition from camouflage to aposematism is rarely direct but tends to involve an intermediary stage, namely cryptic species that facultatively reveal conspicuous coloration.

In fluctuating environments, such phenotype–environment mismatches may therefore reflect a bias to overestimate environmental cues and avoid making the costliest error, ultimately enhancing lifetime fitness.","2023-01-20","2024-07-06 07:21:02","2024-07-06 16:54:35","2024-07-06 07:21:02","269-272","","6629","379","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/MFIRKVS3/Petrullo et al. - 2023 - Phenotype–environment mismatch errors enhance life.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our findings reveal how the loss of H2A–H2B grants remodelers access to a different, yet unexplored layer of energy-driven chromatin regulation.","2023-07-21","2024-07-06 16:39:36","2024-07-06 16:39:44","2024-07-06 16:39:36","313-319","","6655","381","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/8LK6QCVU/Zhang et al. - 2023 - Hexasome-INO80 complex reveals structural basis of.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ideally, miniature sensors should be wireless, inexpensive, and allow for remote detection over sufficient distance by an affordable detection system. We analyze the signal strength of wireless sensors theoretically and derive a simple design of high-signal resonant magneto-mechanical sensors featuring volumes below 1 cubic millimeter. As examples, we demonstrate real-time tracking of position and attitude of a flying bee, navigation of a biopsy needle, tracking of a free-flowing marker, and sensing of pressure and temperature, all in unshielded environments. The achieved sensor size, measurement accuracy, and workspace of ~25 centimeters show the potential for a low-cost wireless tracking and sensing platform for medical and nonmedical applications.","2023-06-02","2024-07-06 16:40:23","2024-07-06 16:40:53","2024-07-06 16:40:23","966-971","","6648","380","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/6B5GTNSM/Gleich et al. - 2023 - Miniature magneto-mechanical resonators for wirele.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Short-term immobility-related conditions are a major risk factor for the development of VTE. Paradoxically, long-term immobilized free-ranging hibernating brown bears and paralyzed spinal cord injury (SCI) patients are protected from VTE. We aimed to identify mechanisms of immobility-associated VTE protection in a cross-species approach. Mass spectrometry–based proteomics revealed an antithrombotic signature in platelets of hibernating brown bears with heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) as the most substantially reduced protein. HSP47 down-regulation or ablation attenuated immune cell activation and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, contributing to thromboprotection in bears, SCI patients, and mice. This cross-species conserved platelet signature may give rise to antithrombotic therapeutics and prognostic markers beyond immobility-associated VTE.","2023-04-14","2024-07-06 16:41:21","2024-07-06 16:41:48","2024-07-06 16:41:21","178-187","","6641","380","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/4YW8RCNT/Thienel et al. - 2023 - Immobility-associated thromboprotection is conserv.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Elasmobranchs declined by >62% at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary and did not fully recover in the Paleocene. The end-Cretaceous event triggered a heterogeneous pattern of extinction, with rays and durophagous species reaching the highest levels of extinction (>72%) and sharks and nondurophagous species being less affected. Taxa with large geographic ranges and/or those restricted to high-latitude settings show higher survival.

We characterized protease activity in lymph nodes and found that antigens were rapidly degraded in the subcapsular sinus, paracortex, and interfollicular regions, whereas low protease activity and antigen degradation rates were detected in the vicinity of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). Correlated with these findings, immunization regimens designed to target antigen to FDCs led to germinal centers dominantly targeting intact antigen, whereas traditional immunizations led to much weaker responses that equally targeted the intact immunogen and antigen breakdown products. Thus, spatially compartmentalized antigen proteolysis affects humoral immunity and can be exploited.","2023-01-27","2024-07-06 17:02:27","2024-07-06 17:02:53","2024-07-06 17:02:27","eabn8934","","6630","379","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/NJIZWHKN/Aung et al. - 2023 - Low protease activity in B cell follicles promotes.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sarcomas are rare malignancies predominantly derived from embryonic mesoderm. To identify pathways specific to mesenchymal cancers, we performed whole-genome germline sequencing on 1644 sporadic cases and 3205 matched healthy elderly controls. Using an extreme phenotype design, a combined rare-variant burden and ontologic analysis identified two sarcoma-specific pathways involved in mitotic and telomere functions. Variants in centrosome genes are linked to malignant peripheral nerve sheath and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, whereas heritable defects in the shelterin complex link susceptibility to sarcoma, melanoma, and thyroid cancers.
