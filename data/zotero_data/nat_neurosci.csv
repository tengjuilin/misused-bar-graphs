In the present study, in a mouse model of HTN, we find that the neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction depends on interleukin (IL)-17, a cytokine elevated in individuals with HTN. However, neither circulating IL-17 nor brain angiotensin signaling can account for the dysfunction. Rather, IL-17 produced by T cells in the dura mater is the mediator released in the cerebrospinal fluid and activating IL-17 receptors on border-associated macrophages (BAMs). Accordingly, depleting BAMs, deleting IL-17 receptor A in brain macrophages or suppressing meningeal T cells rescues cognitive function without attenuating blood pressure elevation, circulating IL-17 or brain angiotensin signaling. Our data unveil a critical role of meningeal T cells and macrophage IL-17 signaling in the neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction in a mouse model of HTN.","2024-01","2024-05-28 05:56:02","2024-05-28 06:19:39","2024-05-28 05:56:02","63-77","","1","27","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/D29ZGRYW/Santisteban et al. - 2024 - Meningeal interleukin-17-producing T cells mediate.pdf","","No problem","Neuroimmunology; Neuro–vascular interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we examined neural activity of patients with PTSD who were listening to narratives depicting their own memories. An intersubject representational similarity analysis of cross-subject semantic content and neural patterns revealed a differentiation in hippocampal representation by narrative type: semantically similar, sad autobiographical memories elicited similar neural representations across participants. By contrast, within the same individuals, semantically similar trauma memories were not represented similarly. Furthermore, we were able to decode memory type from hippocampal multivoxel patterns. Finally, individual symptom severity modulated semantic representation of the traumatic narratives in the posterior cingulate cortex.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging data suggest that temporal correlations in cortical networks vary across distinct behavioral states, providing for the dynamic reorganization of patterned activity. However, these data generally lack the temporal resolution to establish links between cortical signals and the continuously varying fluctuations in spontaneous behavior observed in awake animals. Here, we used wide-field mesoscopic calcium imaging to monitor cortical dynamics in awake mice and developed an approach to quantify rapidly time-varying functional connectivity. We show that spontaneous behaviors are represented by fast changes in both the magnitude and correlational structure of cortical network activity. Combining mesoscopic imaging with simultaneous cellular-resolution two-photon microscopy demonstrated that correlations among neighboring neurons and between local and large-scale networks also encode behavior. Finally, the dynamic functional connectivity of mesoscale signals revealed subnetworks not predicted by traditional anatomical atlas-based parcellation of the cortex.

In this study, we use fUS to demonstrate a successful implementation of a closed-loop ultrasonic BMI. We streamed fUS data from the posterior parietal cortex of two rhesus macaque monkeys while they performed eye and hand movements. After training, the monkeys controlled up to eight movement directions using the BMI. We also developed a method for pretraining the BMI using data from previous sessions. This enabled immediate control on subsequent days, even those that occurred months apart, without requiring extensive recalibration.

In this study, we identified a subpopulation of ~160 neuropeptide precursor Nts (neurotensin)-expressing neurons in the mouse brainstem nucleus retroambiguus (RAm) that are robustly activated during both neonatal isolation cries and adult social vocalizations. The activity of these neurons is necessary and sufficient for vocalization and bidirectionally controls sound volume.

Here, we demonstrated that neuronal somata perform higher levels of aerobic glycolysis and lower levels of OXPHOS than terminals, both during basal and activated states. We found that the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase 2 (PKM2) is localized predominantly in the somata rather than in the terminals. Deletion of Pkm2 in mice results in a switch from aerobic glycolysis to OXPHOS in neuronal somata, leading to oxidative damage and progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons.

We addressed this by combining head and eye movement measurements with neural recordings in freely moving mice. V1 neurons responded primarily to gaze shifts, where head movements are accompanied by saccadic eye movements, rather than to head movements where compensatory eye movements stabilize gaze. A variety of activity patterns followed gaze shifts and together these formed a temporal sequence that was absent in darkness. Gaze-shift responses resembled those evoked by sequentially flashed stimuli, suggesting a large component corresponds to onset of new visual input. Notably, neurons responded in a sequence that matches their spatial frequency bias, consistent with coarse-to-fine processing.

Using a combination of approaches, including transient antisense oligonucleotide-mediated suppression, sustained shRNA-induced depletion in aging mice, and germline deletion, we show that stathmin-2 has an important role in the establishment and maintenance of neurofilament-dependent axoplasmic organization that is critical for preserving the caliber and conduction velocity of myelinated large-diameter axons. Persistent stathmin-2 loss in adult mice results in pathologies found in ALS, including reduced interneurofilament spacing, axonal caliber collapse that drives tearing within outer myelin layers, diminished conduction velocity, progressive motor and sensory deficits, and muscle denervation.

Here we developed Facemap, a framework consisting of a keypoint tracker and a deep neural network encoder for predicting neural activity. Our algorithm for tracking mouse orofacial behaviors was more accurate than existing pose estimation tools, while the processing speed was several times faster, making it a powerful tool for real-time experimental interventions. The Facemap tracker was easy to adapt to data from new labs, requiring as few as 10 annotated frames for near-optimal performance. We used the keypoints as inputs to a deep neural network which predicts the activity of ~50,000 simultaneously-recorded neurons and, in visual cortex, we doubled the amount of explained variance compared to previous methods. Using this model, we found that the neuronal activity clusters that were well predicted from behavior were more spatially spread out across cortex. We also found that the deep behavioral features from the model had stereotypical, sequential dynamics that were not reversible in time. In summary, Facemap provides a stepping stone toward understanding the function of the brain-wide neural signals and their relation to behavior.","2024-01","2024-05-28 05:56:02","2024-05-28 06:17:51","2024-05-28 05:56:05","187-195","","1","27","","Nat Neurosci","Facemap","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/PTSTTTEL/Syeda et al. - 2024 - Facemap a framework for modeling neural activity .pdf","","No bar","Machine learning; Neural circuits; Neural encoding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Instead of operating as a ‘deprivation counter’, AgRP-neuron activity primarily followed the circadian rest–activity cycle through a process that required an intact suprachiasmatic nucleus and synchronization by light. Imposing novel feeding patterns through time-restricted food access or periodic AgRP-neuron stimulation was sufficient to resynchronize the daily AgRP-neuron activity rhythm and drive anticipatory-like behavior through a process that required DMHPDYN neurons.

In mice, both masking and optogenetic silencing of visual cortex (V1) reduce performance over a similar timecourse but have distinct effects on response rates and accuracy. Activity in V1 is consistent with masked behavior when quantified over long, but not short, time windows. A dual accumulator model recapitulates both mouse and human behavior. The model and subjects’ performance imply that the initial spikes in V1 can trigger a correct response, but subsequent V1 activity degrades performance. Supporting this hypothesis, optogenetically suppressing mask-evoked activity in V1 fully restores accurate behavior. Together, these results demonstrate that mice, like humans, are susceptible to masking and that target and mask information is first confounded downstream of V1.","2024-01","2024-05-28 05:56:02","2024-05-28 06:22:28","2024-05-28 05:56:05","129-136","","1","27","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/YHZITBES/Gale et al. - 2024 - Backward masking in mice requires visual cortex.pdf","","No problem","Sensory processing; Visual system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use in vivo two-photon imaging of calcium-mediated cellular/synaptic activity, electrophysiology and c-Fos-activity tagging to show control of neuronal activity is dysregulated in the visual cortex in late adulthood. Specifically, in young adult cortex, mGluR5-dependent population-wide excitatory synaptic weakening and inhibitory synaptogenesis reduce cortical activity following overstimulation. In later life, these mechanisms are downregulated, so that overstimulation results in synaptic strengthening and elevated activity. We also find overstimulation disrupts cognition in older but not younger animals.

However, such processes have yet to be experimentally observed. Here we demonstrate that repeated optogenetic activation of excitatory neurons in monkey visual cortex (area V1) induces a population-wide dynamic reduction in the strength of neuronal interactions over the timescale of minutes during the awake state, but not during rest. This new form of rapid plasticity was observed only in the correlation structure, with firing rates remaining stable across trials. A computational network model operating in the balanced regime confirmed experimental findings and revealed that inhibitory plasticity is responsible for the decrease in correlated activity in response to repeated light stimulation.

To that end, sensory networks in the brain must form object representations invariant to stimulus changes, such as size, orientation and context. Although Hebbian plasticity is known to shape sensory networks, it fails to create invariant object representations in computational models, raising the question of how the brain achieves such processing. In the present study, we show that combining Hebbian plasticity with a predictive form of plasticity leads to invariant representations in deep neural network models. We derive a local learning rule that generalizes to spiking neural networks and naturally accounts for several experimentally observed properties of synaptic plasticity, including metaplasticity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Finally, our model accurately captures neuronal selectivity changes observed in the primate inferotemporal cortex in response to altered visual experience.

We uncover a circuit architecture in which a single cell type implements direction-selective, motion-opponent inhibition at all three network levels. This inhibition, mediated by GluClα receptors, is balanced with excitation in strength, despite tenfold fewer synapses. The different opponent network levels constitute a nested, hierarchical structure operating at increasing spatiotemporal scales.

Bidirectional optogenetic manipulations demonstrate that excitatory mPFC neurons promote REM sleep through their projections to the lateral hypothalamus and regulate phasic events, reflected in accelerated electroencephalogram theta oscillations and increased eye movement density during REM sleep. Calcium imaging reveals that the majority of lateral hypothalamus-projecting mPFC neurons are maximally activated during REM sleep and a subpopulation is recruited during phasic theta accelerations.

It is unclear whether ketamine acts solely through GluN2B-dependent mechanisms. The present study reports that the loss of another major NMDAR subunit, GluN2A, in adult mouse brains elicits robust antidepressant-like responses with limited impact on the behaviors that mimic the psychomimetic effects of ketamine. The antidepressant-like behavioral effects of broad NMDAR channel blockers, such as ketamine and MK-801 (dizocilpine), were mediated by the suppression of GluN2A, but not by the inhibition of GluN2B. Moreover, treatment with ketamine or MK-801 rapidly increased the intrinsic excitability of hippocampal principal neurons through GluN2A, but not GluN2B.

Our approach uses simultaneous multiplane imaging to monitor activity within contiguous tissue volumes with no penalty in speed or requirement for high excitation power. This approach, multi-Z imaging with confocal detection (MuZIC), permits high signal-to-noise ratio voltage imaging in densely labeled neuronal populations and is compatible with imaging through micro-optics. Moreover, it minimizes artifacts associated with concurrent imaging and optogenetic photostimulation for all-optical electrophysiology.","2023-09","2024-05-28 05:56:52","2024-05-29 22:13:59","2024-05-28 05:56:52","1642-1650","","9","26","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ACGVG6UI/Weber et al. - 2023 - High-speed multiplane confocal microscopy for volt.pdf","","No bar","Fluorescence imaging; Confocal microscopy; Optogenetics; Neural circuits; Membrane potential","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We therefore develop a theory of cerebellum-like structures in conjunction with their afferent pathways that predicts the role of the pontine relay to cerebellum and the glomerular organization of the insect antennal lobe. We highlight a new computational distinction between clustered and distributed neuronal representations that is reflected in the anatomy of these two brain structures.

Transcriptomic changes suggest that ASD pathogenesis in macrocephalic and normocephalic probands involves an opposite disruption of the balance between excitatory neurons of the dorsal cortical plate and other lineages such as early-generated neurons from the putative preplate. The imbalance stemmed from divergent expression of transcription factors driving cell fate during early cortical development.

Here we show that dorsomedial prefrontal cortical (dmPFC) astrocytes modulate E/I balance and dominance behavior in adult male mice using in vivo fiber photometry and two-photon microscopy. Optogenetic and chemogenetic activation or inhibition of dmPFC astrocytes show that astrocytes bidirectionally control male mouse dominance behavior, affecting social rank. Dominant and subordinate male mice present distinct prefrontal synaptic E/I balance, regulated by astrocyte activity. Mechanistically, we show that dmPFC astrocytes control cortical E/I balance by simultaneously enhancing presynaptic-excitatory and reducing postsynaptic-inhibitory transmission via astrocyte-derived glutamate and ATP release, respectively.

Here we report that medial preoptic area (MPOA) GABAergic neurons mediate multifaceted depressive-like behaviors in female mice after ovarian hormone withdrawal (HW), which can be attributed to downregulation of activity in Esr1 (estrogen receptor-1)-expressing GABAergic neurons. Enhancing activity of these neurons ameliorates depressive-like behaviors in HW-treated mice, whereas reducing their activity results in expression of these behaviors. Two separate subpopulations mediate different symptoms: a subpopulation projecting to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) mediates anhedonia and another projecting to the periaqueductal gray mediates immobility. These projections enhance activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA and serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe, respectively, with increased release of dopamine and serotonin, possibly through disinhibition mechanisms.

Here we introduce a new neural network formalization of systems consolidation that reveals an overlooked tension—unregulated neocortical memory transfer can cause overfitting and harm generalization in an unpredictable world. We resolve this tension by postulating that memories only consolidate when it aids generalization.

We found that organized motor control is mediated by enhanced population coding of direction-tuned premotor neurons, with tuning refined through suppression of irrelevant neuronal activity. ChCs contribute to learning-dependent refinements by providing selective inhibitory control over individual pyramidal neurons rather than global suppression. Quantitative analysis of structural plasticity across axo-axonic synapses revealed that ChCs redistributed inhibitory weights to individual pyramidal neurons during learning.

In the developing human brain, cortical progenitors transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis in a stereotyped sequence that is in part influenced by extrinsic ligands. Here we used published transcriptomic data to identify and functionally test five ligand–receptor pairs that synergistically drive human astrogenesis. We validate the synergistic contributions of TGFβ2, NLGN1, TSLP, DKK1 and BMP4 ligands on astrocyte development in both hCOs and primary fetal tissue. We confirm that the cooperative capabilities of these five ligands are greater than their individual capacities. Additionally, we discovered that their combinatorial effects converge in part on the mTORC1 signaling pathway, resulting in transcriptomic and morphological features of astrocyte development.

Here, we measured the impact of temperature on striatal population activity and the behavior of rats, and compared the observed effects with neural activity and behavior collected in multiple versions of a temporal categorization task. Cooling caused dilation, and warming contraction, of both neural activity and patterns of judgment in time, mimicking endogenous decision-related variability in striatal activity. However, temperature did not similarly affect movement kinematics. These data provide compelling evidence that the timecourse of evolving striatal activity dictates the speed of a latent process that is used to guide choices, but not continuous motor control.

Using intracranial electroencephalography combined with multiunit activity recordings from the human hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) areas, we show that, governed by slow oscillation (SO) up-states, sleep spindles set a timeframe for ripples to occur. This sequential coupling leads to a stepwise increase in (1) neuronal FRs, (2) short-latency cross-correlations among local neuronal assemblies and (3) cross-regional MTL interactions. Triggered by SOs and spindles, ripples thus establish optimal conditions for spike-timing-dependent plasticity and systems consolidation.

The age of onset in ADAD is highly predictable within families, allowing researchers to estimate an individual’s point in the disease trajectory. These characteristics allow candidate AD biomarker measurements to be reliably mapped during the preclinical phase.

Therefore, myelin is widely considered to be a protective structure for axons in multiple sclerosis. Myelinated axons also depend on oligodendrocytes, which provide metabolic and structural support to the axonal compartment. Given that axonal pathology in multiple sclerosis is already visible at early disease stages, before overt demyelination, we reasoned that autoimmune inflammation may disrupt oligodendroglial support mechanisms and hence primarily affect axons insulated by myelin. Here, we studied axonal pathology as a function of myelination in human multiple sclerosis and mouse models of autoimmune encephalomyelitis with genetically altered myelination. We demonstrate that myelin ensheathment itself becomes detrimental for axonal survival and increases the risk of axons degenerating in an autoimmune environment. This challenges the view of myelin as a solely protective structure and suggests that axonal dependence on oligodendroglial support can become fatal when myelin is under inflammatory attack.","2023-07","2024-05-28 05:56:52","2024-05-29 22:29:33","2024-05-28 05:56:53","1218-1228","","7","26","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/GUG3UZCN/Schäffner et al. - 2023 - Myelin insulation as a risk factor for axonal dege.pdf","","Log","Multiple sclerosis; Oligodendrocyte","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, the m6A modification in the C9ORF72 intron sequence upstream of the expanded repeats enhances RNA decay via the nuclear reader YTHDC1, and the antisense RNA repeats can also be regulated through m6A modification. The m6A reduction increases the accumulation of repeat RNAs and the encoded poly-dipeptides, contributing to disease pathogenesis.

We integrated the receptor data with anatomical, genetic and functional connectivity data into a common cortical space. We uncovered a principal gradient of receptor expression per neuron. This aligns with the cortical hierarchy from sensory cortex to higher cognitive areas. A second gradient, driven by serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, peaks in the anterior cingulate, default mode and salience networks. We found a similar pattern of 5-HT1A expression in the human brain.

Here, we report that microglial deletion of miR-155 induces a pre-MGnD activation state via interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling, and blocking IFN-γ signaling attenuates MGnD induction and microglial phagocytosis. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of microglia from an AD mouse model identifies Stat1 and Clec2d as pre-MGnD markers. This phenotypic transition enhances amyloid plaque compaction, reduces dystrophic neurites, attenuates plaque-associated synaptic degradation and improves cognition. Our study demonstrates a miR-155-mediated regulatory mechanism of MGnD and the beneficial role of IFN-γ-responsive pre-MGnD in restricting neurodegenerative pathology and preserving cognitive function in an AD mouse model, highlighting miR-155 and IFN-γ as potential therapeutic targets for AD.","2023-07","2024-05-28 05:56:52","2024-05-29 22:28:44","2024-05-28 05:56:53","1196-1207","","7","26","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/K3ZR6THE/Yin et al. - 2023 - Identification of a protective microglial state me.pdf","","Zero","Alzheimer's disease; Cellular neuroscience; Neuroimmunology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Synchronizing the stimulation to the active phases of endogenous slow waves in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) enhanced sleep spindles, boosted locking of brain-wide neural spiking activity to MTL slow waves, and improved coupling between MTL ripples and thalamocortical oscillations. Furthermore, synchronized stimulation enhanced the accuracy of recognition memory.

However, to make sense of these events, they must be stitched together into an overarching narrative—a model of unfolding events. It has been proposed that such a stitching process happens in offline neural reactivations when rodents build models of spatial environments. Here we show that, while understanding a natural narrative, humans reactivate neural representations of past events. Similar to offline replay, these reactivations occur in the hippocampus and default mode network, where reactivations are selective to relevant past events. However, these reactivations occur, not during prolonged offline periods, but at the boundaries between ongoing narrative events. These results, replicated across two datasets, suggest reactivations as a candidate mechanism for binding temporally distant information into a coherent understanding of ongoing experience.","2023-06","2024-05-28 05:56:52","2024-05-29 22:38:48","2024-05-28 05:56:53","1080-1089","","6","26","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/SRICHZJ3/Hahamy et al. - 2023 - The human brain reactivates context-specific past .pdf","","No problem","Consolidation; Consciousness; Perception; Working memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, we present a new method for producing recombinant full-length TDP-43 filaments that exhibit sequence and morphological features similar to those of brain-derived TDP-43 filaments. We show that TDP-43 filaments contain a β-sheet-rich helical amyloid core that is fully buried by the flanking structured domains of the protein. We demonstrate that the proteolytic cleavage of TDP-43 filaments and exposure of this amyloid core are necessary for propagating TDP-43 pathology and enhancing the seeding of brain-derived TDP-43 aggregates. Only TDP-43 filaments with exposed amyloid core efficiently seeded the aggregation of endogenous TDP-43 in cells.

Next, we showed that mice can learn to compensate for a predictable reach perturbation caused by repeated, closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of pontocerebellar mossy fiber inputs. Both neural and behavioral readouts showed adaptation to position-locked mossy fiber perturbations and exhibited aftereffects when stimulation was removed.

Here we report an unexpected finding that endocannabinoid release requires synucleins, key contributors to Parkinson’s disease. We show that endocannabinoids are released postsynaptically by a synuclein-dependent and SNARE-dependent mechanism. Specifically, we found that synuclein deletion blocks endocannabinoid-dependent synaptic plasticity; this block is reversed by postsynaptic expression of wild-type but not of mutant α-synuclein. Whole-cell recordings and direct optical monitoring of endocannabinoid signaling suggest that the synuclein deletion specifically blocks endocannabinoid release. Given the presynaptic role of synucleins in regulating vesicle lifecycle, we hypothesize that endocannabinoids are released via a membrane interaction mechanism. Consistent with this hypothesis, postsynaptic expression of tetanus toxin light chain, which cleaves synaptobrevin SNAREs, also blocks endocannabinoid-dependent signaling. The unexpected finding that endocannabinoids are released via a synuclein-dependent mechanism is consistent with a general function of synucleins in membrane trafficking and adds a piece to the longstanding puzzle of how neurons release endocannabinoids to induce synaptic plasticity.","2023-06","2024-05-28 05:56:52","2024-05-29 22:42:08","2024-05-28 05:56:53","997-1007","","6","26","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/35ERC9HB/Albarran et al. - 2023 - Postsynaptic synucleins mediate endocannabinoid si.pdf","","No bar","Cellular neuroscience; Neurotransmitters; Long-term depression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pathogenic tau activates cGAS and IFN-I responses in microglia, in part mediated by cytosolic leakage of mitochondrial DNA. Genetic ablation of Cgas in mice with tauopathy diminished the microglial IFN-I response, preserved synapse integrity and plasticity and protected against cognitive impairment without affecting the pathogenic tau load. cGAS ablation increased, while activation of IFN-I decreased, the neuronal MEF2C expression network linked to cognitive resilience in AD.

Notably, cMPOAEsr1 cell responses to male opponents correlated with the opponents’ fighting capability, which mice could estimate based on physical traits or learn through physical combats. Inactivating the cMPOAEsr1–VMHvl pathway increased aggression, whereas activating the pathway suppressed natural intermale aggression.

Furthermore, under conditions of inflammatory and neuropathic pain, prefrontal fear engrams expand to encompass neurons representing nociception and tactile sensation, leading to pronounced changes in prefrontal connectivity to fear-relevant brain areas.

Mirroring behavior, the hippocampus not only builds a map of spatial relationships but also encodes the experienced transition structure. As the task progresses, participants’ choices become more influenced by spatial relationships, reflected in a strengthening of the spatial map and a weakening of the predictive map.

Using in vivo imaging and electrophysiology in mouse visual cortex, we describe a critical role for cortical astrocytes in circuit resynchronization. We characterize astrocytes’ calcium responses to changes in behavioral arousal and NE, and show that astrocytes signal when arousal-driven neuronal activity is reduced and bi-hemispheric cortical synchrony is increased.

However, it remains unknown whether sensory cholinergic signals target the sensory cortex and how they relate to local functional topography. Here we used simultaneous two-channel, two-photon imaging of CBF axons and auditory cortical neurons to reveal that CBF axons send a robust, nonhabituating and stimulus-specific sensory signal to the auditory cortex. Individual axon segments exhibited heterogeneous but stable tuning to auditory stimuli allowing stimulus identity to be decoded from population activity. However, CBF axons displayed no tonotopy and their frequency tuning was uncoupled from that of nearby cortical neurons. Chemogenetic suppression revealed the auditory thalamus as a major source of auditory information to the CBF. Finally, slow fluctuations in cholinergic activity modulated the fast, sensory-evoked signals in the same axons, suggesting that a multiplexed combination of fast and slow signals is projected from the CBF to the auditory cortex. Taken together, our work demonstrates a noncanonical function of the CBF as a parallel channel for state-dependent sensory signaling to the sensory cortex that provides repeated representations of a broad range of sound stimuli at all points on the tonotopic map.","2023-05","2024-05-28 05:58:00","2024-05-29 22:42:47","2024-05-28 05:58:01","810-819","","5","26","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/6ZRCXCHH/Zhu et al. - 2023 - The cholinergic basal forebrain provides a paralle.pdf","","No problem","Neural circuits; Cortex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Spatiotemporal variability in regional developmental trajectories was organized along a hierarchical, sensorimotor–association cortical axis from ages 8 to 18. The sensorimotor–association axis furthermore captured variation in associations between youths’ neighborhood environments and intrinsic fMRI activity; associations suggest that the effects of environmental disadvantage on the maturing brain diverge most across this axis during midadolescence.

In the present study, we show in mice that, when the brain is forced into a minimum responsive state by diverse anesthetics, a rapid downregulation of K+/Cl− cotransporter 2 (KCC2) in the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) serves as a common mechanism by which the brain regains consciousness. Ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation is responsible for KCC2 downregulation, which is driven by ubiquitin ligase Fbxl4. Phosphorylation of KCC2 at Thr1007 promotes interaction between KCC2 and Fbxl4. KCC2 downregulation leads to γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor-mediated disinhibition, enabling accelerated recovery of VPM neuron excitability and emergence of consciousness from anesthetic inhibition. This pathway to recovery is an active process and occurs independent of anesthetic choice.

However, what ANs encode and where they convey these signals remains largely unknown. Here, through large-scale functional imaging in behaving animals and morphological quantification, we report the behavioral encoding and brain targeting of hundreds of genetically identifiable ANs in the adult fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We reveal that ANs encode behavioral states, specifically conveying self-motion to the anterior ventrolateral protocerebrum, an integrative sensory hub, as well as discrete actions to the gnathal ganglia, a locus for action selection. Additionally, AN projection patterns within the motor system are predictive of their encoding. Thus, ascending populations are well poised to inform distinct brain hubs of self-motion and ongoing behaviors and may provide an important substrate for computations that are required for adaptive behavior.","2023-04","2024-05-28 05:58:00","2024-05-29 22:56:14","2024-05-28 05:58:01","682-695","","4","26","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/PC8GYM8Y/Chen et al. - 2023 - Ascending neurons convey behavioral state to integ.pdf","","No bar","High-throughput screening; Software; Neural circuits; Spinal cord","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To investigate the cellular dynamics underlying these events, we developed a noninflammatory demyelination model that combines intravital two-photon imaging with a single-cell ablation technique called two-photon apoptotic targeted ablation (2Phatal). Oligodendrocyte 2Phatal in both sexes results in a myelin degeneration cascade that triggers rapid forms of synchronous remyelination on defined axons. This remyelination is driven by oligodendrocytes differentiated from a subset of morphologically distinct, highly branched OPCs. Moreover, remyelination efficiency depends on the initial myelin patterns, as well as the age of the organism.

By integrating neuroimaging data with normative gene expression data from two independent transcriptomic atlases, we found that within each subgroup, ASD-related functional connectivity was explained by regional differences in the expression of distinct ASD-related gene sets.

We show that learning on social networks can be approximated by a well-established error-driven process for observational learning, supported by an action prediction error encoded in the lateral prefrontal cortex. Importantly, learning is flexibly weighted toward well-connected neighbors, according to activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, but only insofar as social observations contain secondhand, potentially intertwining, information.

These neurons directly activate vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing interneurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), causing disinhibition of pyramidal neurons and allodynia.

Inhibition of this pathway during NREM sleep, but not wakefulness, corrects neuronal hyperactivation and alleviates pain.

Inhibition of activity in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neurons that project to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) preferentially disrupts this relationship between value and motivation in females, without affecting choice in either sex. In line with these effects, in females compared to males, ACC–DMS neurons have stronger representations of negative outcomes and more neurons are active when the value of the chosen option is low. By contrast, the representation of each choice is similar between the sexes. Thus, we identify a neural substrate that contributes to sex-specific modulation of motivation by value.","2023-02","2024-05-28 05:58:00","2024-05-29 23:05:46","2024-05-28 05:58:01","274-284","","2","26","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/VAEQ6A2M/Cox et al. - 2023 - A neural substrate of sex-dependent modulation of .pdf","","No problem","Neural circuits; Motivation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This representational ‘drift’ naturally leads to questions about its causes, dynamics and functions. Here we explore the hypothesis that neural representations optimize a representational objective with a degenerate solution space, and noisy synaptic updates drive the network to explore this (near-)optimal space causing representational drift. We illustrate this idea and explore its consequences in simple, biologically plausible Hebbian/anti-Hebbian network models of representation learning. We find that the drifting receptive fields of individual neurons can be characterized by a coordinated random walk, with effective diffusion constants depending on various parameters such as learning rate, noise amplitude and input statistics. Despite such drift, the representational similarity of population codes is stable over time. Our model recapitulates experimental observations in the hippocampus and posterior parietal cortex and makes testable predictions that can be probed in future experiments.","2023-02","2024-05-28 05:58:00","2024-05-29 23:04:19","2024-05-28 05:58:01","339-349","","2","26","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/TRW966KJ/Qin et al. - 2023 - Coordinated drift of receptive fields in Hebbiana.pdf","","No problem","Learning and memory; Synaptic plasticity; Computational neuroscience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, inferring the nature of recurrent dynamics from partial recordings of a neural circuit presents considerable challenges. Here we show that some of these challenges can be overcome by a fine-grained analysis of the dynamics of neural residuals—that is, trial-by-trial variability around the mean neural population trajectory for a given task condition. Residual dynamics in macaque prefrontal cortex (PFC) in a saccade-based perceptual decision-making task reveals recurrent dynamics that is time dependent, but consistently stable, and suggests that pronounced rotational structure in PFC trajectories during saccades is driven by inputs from upstream areas. The properties of residual dynamics restrict the possible contributions of PFC to decision-making and saccade generation and suggest a path toward fully characterizing distributed neural computations with large-scale neural recordings and targeted causal perturbations.","2023-02","2024-05-28 05:58:12","2024-05-29 23:04:54","2024-05-28 05:58:12","326-338","","2","26","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/8RX3UUNR/Galgali et al. - 2023 - Residual dynamics resolves recurrent contributions.pdf","","No problem","Network models; Decision; Dynamical systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we describe a high-affinity human TREM2-activating antibody engineered with a monovalent transferrin receptor (TfR) binding site, termed antibody transport vehicle (ATV), to facilitate blood–brain barrier transcytosis. Upon peripheral delivery in mice, ATV:TREM2 showed improved brain biodistribution and enhanced signaling compared to a standard anti-TREM2 antibody. In human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia, ATV:TREM2 induced proliferation and improved mitochondrial metabolism. Single-cell RNA sequencing and morphometry revealed that ATV:TREM2 shifted microglia to metabolically responsive states, which were distinct from those induced by amyloid pathology. In an AD mouse model, ATV:TREM2 boosted brain microglial activity and glucose metabolism. Thus, ATV:TREM2 represents a promising approach to improve microglial function and treat brain hypometabolism found in patients with AD.","2023-03","2024-05-28 05:58:12","2024-05-29 22:59:40","2024-05-28 05:58:12","416-429","","3","26","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/7SR7659V/van Lengerich et al. - 2023 - A TREM2-activating antibody with a blood–brain bar.pdf","","No problem","Drug delivery; Microglia; Blood–brain barrier; Alzheimer's disease; Neuroimmunology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For instance, primary visual cortex (V1) is influenced not only by images but also by sounds. Here we show that the activity evoked by sounds in V1, measured with Neuropixels probes, is stereotyped across neurons and even across mice. It is independent of projections from auditory cortex and resembles activity evoked in the hippocampal formation, which receives little direct auditory input. Its low-dimensional nature starkly contrasts the high-dimensional code that V1 uses to represent images. Furthermore, this sound-evoked activity can be precisely predicted by small body movements that are elicited by each sound and are stereotyped across trials and mice. Thus, neural activity that is apparently multisensory may simply arise from low-dimensional signals associated with internal state and behavior.","2023-02","2024-05-28 05:58:12","2024-05-29 23:06:16","2024-05-28 05:58:13","251-258","","2","26","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/D4SW8ZTD/Bimbard et al. - 2023 - Behavioral origin of sound-evoked activity in mous.pdf","","No problem","Cortex; Sensory processing; Striate cortex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied the representational geometry in the somatosensory cortex of mice trained to report the curvature of objects touched by their whiskers. High-speed videos of the whiskers revealed that the task can be solved by linearly integrating multiple whisker contacts over time. However, the neural activity in somatosensory cortex reflects non-linear integration of spatio-temporal features of the sensory inputs. Although the responses at first appeared disorganized, we identified an interesting structure in the representational geometry: different whisker contacts are disentangled variables represented in approximately, but not fully, orthogonal subspaces of the neural activity space. This geometry allows linear readouts to perform a broad class of tasks of different complexities without compromising the ability to generalize to novel situations.","2023-02","2024-05-28 05:58:12","2024-05-29 23:05:16","2024-05-28 05:58:13","239-250","","2","26","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/W87G4M38/Nogueira et al. - 2023 - The geometry of cortical representations of touch .pdf","","Zero","Network models; Neural encoding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SARS-CoV-2 brain replication occurs primarily in neurons, leading to neuronal loss, signs of glial activation and vascular damage in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. One or two doses of a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vector expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (MVA-CoV2-S) conferred full protection against SARS-CoV-2 cerebral infection, preventing virus replication in all areas of the brain and its associated damage.
