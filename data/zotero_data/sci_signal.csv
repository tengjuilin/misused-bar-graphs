Tissue-resident macrophages, which are infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients but are inconsistently infected in vitro, exert critical but conflicting effects by secreting both antiviral type I interferons (IFNs) and tissue-damaging inflammatory cytokines. Steroids, the only class of host-targeting drugs approved for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), indiscriminately suppress both responses, possibly impairing viral clearance. Here, we established in vitro cell culture systems that enabled us to separately investigate the cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic proinflammatory and antiviral activities of mouse macrophages infected with the prototypical murine coronavirus MHV-A59. We showed that the nuclear factor κB–dependent inflammatory response to viral infection was selectively inhibited by loss of the lysine demethylase LSD1, which was previously implicated in innate immune responses to cancer, with negligible effects on the antiviral IFN response. LSD1 ablation also enhanced an IFN-independent antiviral response, blocking viral egress through the lysosomal pathway. The macrophage-intrinsic antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity of Lsd1 inhibition was confirmed in vitro and in a humanized mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results suggest that LSD1 controls innate immune responses against coronaviruses at multiple levels and provide a mechanistic rationale for potentially repurposing LSD1 inhibitors for COVID-19 treatment.","2023-12-19","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 02:37:45","eade0326","","816","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/YPKFMNJG/Mazzarella et al. - 2023 - Inhibition of the lysine demethylase LSD1 modulate.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In human cancer cells, IRAK4 was activated downstream of ATR kinase in response to double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation (IR). Activated IRAK4 then formed a complex with and activated IRAK1. The formation of this complex required the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino1, acting structurally but not catalytically, and the activation of IRAK1 occurred independently of extracellular signaling, intracellular TLRs, and the TLR/IL-1R signaling adaptor MyD88. Activated IRAK1 translocated to the nucleus in a Pellino2-dependent manner. In the nucleus, IRAK1 bound to the PIDD1 subunit of the proapoptotic PIDDosome and interfered with platform assembly, thus supporting cell survival. This noncanonical IRAK signaling pathway was also activated in response to other DSB-inducing agents. The loss of IRAK4, of IRAK4 kinase activity, of either Pellino protein, or of the nuclear localization sequence in IRAK1 sensitized p53-mutant zebrafish to radiation.

Here, we investigated the consequences of S-palmitoylation of STAT3 in HCC. Increased ZDHHC7 abundance in HCC cases was associated with poor prognosis, as revealed by bioinformatics analysis of patient data. In HepG2 cells in vitro, DHHC7-mediated palmitoylation enhanced the expression of STAT3 target genes, including HIF1A, which encodes the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF1α. Inhibiting DHHC7 decreased the S-palmitoylation of STAT3 and decreased HIF1α abundance. Furthermore, stabilization of HIF1α by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) enabled it to promote the expression of ZDHHC7, which generated a positive feedback loop between DHHC7, STAT3, and HIF1α. Perturbing this loop reduced the growth of HCC cells in vivo. Moreover, DHHC7, STAT3, and HIF1α were all abundant in human HCC tissues.

We identified Sept8-204 as a brain-specific variant of Sept8 that was abundant in neurons and modified by palmitoylation, specifically at Cys469, Cys470, and Cys472. Sept8-204 palmitoylation was mediated by the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC7 and was removed by the depalmitoylase PPT1.

In contrast, a Sept8-204 variant that could not be palmitoylated because of mutation of all three Cys residues (Sept8-204-3CA) lost its ability to bind F-actin, and expression of this mutant did not promote morphological changes. Genetic deletion of Sept8, Sept8-204, or Zdhhc7 caused deficits in learning and memory and promoted anxiety-like behaviors in mice.

Because dynamic actin remodeling is crucial for T cell functions, we characterized the effects of PD-1 engagement on actin remodeling at the immunological synapse, the interface between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell (APC) or target cell. We used microscopy to analyze the formation of immunological synapses between PD-1+ Jurkat cells or primary human CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and APCs that presented T cell–activating antibodies and were either positive or negative for PD-L1. PD-1 binding to PD-L1 inhibited T cell spreading induced by antibody-mediated activation, which was characterized by the absence of the F-actin–dense distal lamellipodial network at the immunological synapse and the Arp2/3 complex, which mediates branched actin formation. PD-1–induced inhibition of actin remodeling also prevented the characteristic deformation of T cells that contact APCs and the release of cytotoxic granules. We showed that the effects of PD-1 on actin remodeling did not require its tyrosine-based signaling motifs, which are thought to mediate the co-inhibitory effects of PD-1.

The terminals of sensory neurons innervating the gut are surrounded by glia. Here, using a mouse model of acute colitis, we found that enteric glia contribute to visceral pain by secreting factors that sensitized sensory nerves innervating the gut in response to inflammation. Acute colitis induced a transient increase in the production of proinflammatory cytokines in the intestines of male and female mice. Of these, IL-1β was produced in part by glia and augmented the opening of the intercellular communication hemichannel connexin-43 in glia, which made normally innocuous stimuli painful in female mice. Chemogenetic glial activation paired with calcium imaging in nerve terminals demonstrated that glia sensitized gut-innervating nociceptors only under inflammatory conditions. This inflammatory, glial-driven visceral hypersensitivity involved an increased abundance of the enzyme COX-2 in glia, resulting in greater production and release of prostaglandin E2 that activated EP4 receptors on sensory nerve terminals. Blocking EP4 receptors reduced nociceptor sensitivity in response to glial stimulation in tissue samples from colitis-model mice, and impairing glial connexin-43 reduced visceral hypersensitivity induced by IL-1β in female mice. The findings suggest that therapies targeting enteric glial–neuron signaling might alleviate visceral pain caused by inflammatory disorders.","2023-11-21","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 02:38:21","eadg1668","","812","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/C27ZAN69/Morales-Soto et al. - 2023 - Enteric glia promote visceral hypersensitivity dur.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TMEM16A channels generated calcium (Ca2+)–activated Cl− currents in endothelial cells from control (TMEM16Afl/fl) mice that were absent in those from mice with tamoxifen-inducible, endothelial cell–specific knockout of TMEM16A (TMEM16A ecKO). TMEM16A currents in endothelial cells were activated by the muscarinic receptor agonist acetylcholine and an agonist of the Ca2+ channel TRPV4, which localized in nanoscale proximity with TMEM16A as assessed by single-molecule localization imaging of endothelial cells. Acetylcholine stimulated TMEM16A currents by activating Ca2+ influx through surface TRPV4 channels without altering the nanoscale properties of TMEM16A and TRPV4 surface clusters or their colocalization. In pressurized arteries, activation of TMEM16A channels in endothelial cells induced by acetylcholine; TRPV4 channel stimulation; or intraluminal ATP, another vasodilator, produced hyperpolarization and dilation. Furthermore, deficiency of TMEM16A channels in endothelial cells resulted in increased systemic blood pressure in conscious mice. These data indicate that vasodilators stimulate TRPV4 channels, leading to Ca2+-dependent activation of nearby TMEM16A channels in endothelial cells to produce arterial hyperpolarization, vasodilation, and reduced blood pressure. Thus, TMEM16A is an anion channel in endothelial cells that regulates arterial contractility and blood pressure.","2023-11-14","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 02:38:23","eadh9399","","811","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/TCMFAZ2J/Mata-Daboin et al. - 2023 - Vasodilators activate the anion channel TMEM16A in.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we report that this pathology was associated with the loss of myogenic vasoconstriction, an intrinsic vascular response essential for the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow. Electrophysiological analyses showed that the loss of myogenic constriction resulted from blunted pressure-induced smooth muscle cell (SMC) membrane depolarization. Furthermore, we found that dysregulation of membrane potential was associated with impaired Ca2+-dependent activation of large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) and transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) cation channels linked to disruptions in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ signaling. Col4a1 mutations impair protein folding, which can cause SR stress.

To better understand the mechanisms that regulate Notch function in cancer, we studied Notch signaling in a Drosophila tumor model, prostate cancer–derived cell lines, and tissue samples from patients with advanced prostate cancer. We demonstrated that increased activity of the Src-JNK pathway in tumors inactivated Notch signaling because of JNK pathway–mediated inhibition of the expression of the gene encoding the Notch S2 cleavage protease, Kuzbanian, which is critical for Notch activity. Consequently, inactive Notch accumulated in cells, where it was unable to transcribe genes encoding its target proteins, many of which have tumor-suppressive activities. These findings suggest that Src-JNK activity in tumors predicts Notch activity status and that suppressing Src-JNK signaling could restore Notch function in tumors, offering opportunities for diagnosis and targeted therapies for a subset of patients with advanced prostate cancer.","2023-11-07","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 02:38:25","eabo5213","","810","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ZN5Q9GAA/Wang et al. - 2023 - A conserved mechanism for JNK-mediated loss of Not.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We analyzed the expression of genes encoding chemokines and their receptors across species, tissues, and diseases. This analysis revealed complex expression patterns such that genes encoding multiple chemokines that mediated recruitment of the same leukocyte type were expressed in the same context, such as the genes encoding the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. Through biophysical approaches, we showed that these chemokines differentially interacted with extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycans (ECM GAGs), which was enhanced by sulfation of specific GAGs. Last, in vivo approaches demonstrated that GAG binding was critical for the CXCL9-dependent recruitment of specific T cell subsets but not of others, irrespective of CXCR3 expression. Our data demonstrate that interactions with ECM GAGs regulated whether chemokines were presented on cell surfaces or remained more soluble, thereby affecting chemokine availability and ensuring specificity of chemokine action.

Excessive protease production occurs in many degenerative diseases, including osteoarthritis, in which articular cartilage degradation is associated with the genesis of matrix protein fragments that can activate integrins. We investigated the mechanisms by which integrin signals may promote protease production in response to matrix changes in osteoarthritis. Using a fragment of the matrix protein fibronectin (FN) to activate the α5β1 integrin in primary human chondrocytes, we found that endocytosis of the integrin and FN fragment complex drove the production of the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-13. Activation of α5β1 by the FN fragment, but not by intact FN, was accompanied by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production initially at the cell surface, then in early endosomes. These ROS-producing endosomes (called redoxosomes) contained the integrin-FN fragment complex, the ROS-producing enzyme NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), and SRC, a redox-regulated kinase that promotes MMP-13 production. In contrast, intact FN was endocytosed and trafficked to recycling endosomes without inducing ROS production. Articular cartilage from patients with osteoarthritis showed increased amounts of SRC and the NOX2 complex component p67phox. Furthermore, we observed enhanced localization of SRC and p67phox at early endosomes, suggesting that redoxosomes could transmit and sustain integrin signaling in response to matrix damage. This signaling mechanism not only amplifies the production of matrix-degrading proteases but also establishes a self-perpetuating cycle that contributes to the ongoing degradation of cartilage matrix in osteoarthritis.","2023-10-31","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 02:38:27","eadf8299","","809","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/UP65VHJE/Miao et al. - 2023 - Redox-active endosomes mediate α5β1 integrin signa.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we found that the docking protein DOK3 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis by suppressing CARD11 activity. DOK3 interacted with CARD11 and decreased its phosphorylation in T cells by recruiting the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 4, thereby dampening downstream signaling. Knocking out Dok3 enhanced the production of the cytokine IFN-γ by T cells, which conferred protection against experimental atopic dermatitis–like skin inflammation in mice. The expression of DOK3 was increased in T cells isolated from patients with atopic dermatitis and inversely correlated with IFNG expression.

Phosphatidylinositols are second messengers produced during T cell activation that transduce signals from the T cell receptor (TCR) and costimulatory receptors at the plasma membrane. Here, we found that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) was enriched in the nuclei of human TH17 cells, which depended on the kinase PIP5K1α, and that inhibition of PIP5K1α impaired IL-17A production. In contrast, nuclear PIP2 enrichment was not observed in TH1 or TH2 cells, and these cells did not require PIP5K1α for cytokine production. In T cells from people with multiple sclerosis, IL-17 production elicited by myelin basic protein was blocked by PIP5K1α inhibition. IL-17 protein was affected without altering either the abundance or stability of IL17A mRNA in TH17 cells. Instead, analysis of PIP5K1α-associating proteins revealed that PIP5K1α interacted with ARS2, a nuclear cap-binding complex scaffold protein, to facilitate its binding to IL17A mRNA and subsequent IL-17A protein production.

In a left lung hilar-ligation model of IRI in mice, we found that lung IRI increased the efflux of ATP through pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels at the endothelial cell (EC) membrane. Elevated extracellular ATP activated Ca2+ influx through endothelial TRPV4 channels downstream of purinergic P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2R) signaling.

We uncovered a role for the lipid phosphatidic acid (PA) in the regulation of the Hh pathway in Drosophila melanogaster. Deleting the Ptc C-terminal tail or mutating the predicted PA-binding sites within it prevented Ptc from inhibiting Smo in wing discs and in cultured cells. The C-terminal tail of Ptc directly interacted with PA in vitro, an association that was reduced by Hh, and increased the amount of PA at the plasma membrane in cultured cells. Smo also interacted with PA in vitro through a binding pocket located in the transmembrane region, and mutating residues in this pocket reduced Smo activity in vivo and in cells. By genetically manipulating PA amounts in vivo or treating cultured cells with PA, we demonstrated that PA promoted Smo activation.

Engineering IL-2 to treat autoimmunity has primarily focused on retaining binding to the relatively Treg-selective, high-affinity receptor while reducing binding to the less selective, low-affinity receptor. However, we found that refining the designs to focus on targeting the high-affinity receptor through avidity effects is key to optimizing Treg selectivity. We profiled the dynamics and dose dependency of signaling responses in primary human immune cells induced by engineered fusions composed of either wild-type IL-2 or mutant forms with altered affinity, valency, and fusion to the antibody Fc region for stability. Treg selectivity and signaling response variations were explained by a model of multivalent binding and dimer-enhanced avidity—a combined measure of the strength, number, and conformation of interaction sites—from which we designed tetravalent IL-2–Fc fusions that had greater Treg selectivity in culture than do current designs. Biasing avidity toward IL2Rα with an asymmetrical multivalent design consisting of one α/β chain–binding and one α chain–binding mutant further enhanced Treg selectivity. Comparative analysis revealed that IL2Rα was the optimal cell surface target for Treg selectivity, indicating that avidity for IL2Rα may be the optimal route to producing IL-2 variants that selectively target Tregs.","2023-10-17","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 02:38:58","eadg0699","","807","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/SYSQFF4V/Orcutt-Jahns et al. - 2023 - Multivalent, asymmetric IL-2–Fc fusions show enhan.pdf","","Log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different chemoattractants can also drive qualitatively different modes of migration even though their receptors couple to the same Gαi family of G proteins. Here, we used live-cell imaging to demonstrate that the responses differed in their signaling dynamics. Low-priority chemoattractants caused transient responses, whereas responses to high-priority chemoattractants were sustained. We observed this difference in both primary neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 cells, for downstream signaling mediated by Ca2+, a major regulator of secretion, and Cdc42, a primary regulator of polarity and cell steering. The rapid attenuation of Cdc42 activation in response to LTB4 depended on the phosphorylation sites Thr308 and Ser310 in the carboxyl-terminal tail of its receptor LTB4R in a manner independent of endocytosis. Mutation of these residues to alanine impaired chemoattractant prioritization, although it did not affect chemoattractant-dependent differences in migration persistence.

Here, we performed an integrated analysis of the dynamics of virus replication and the host cell transcriptional response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using human Caco-2 colon cancer cells as a model. Time-resolved RNA sequencing revealed that, upon infection, cells immediately transcriptionally activated genes associated with inflammatory pathways that mediate the antiviral response, which was followed by an increase in the expression of genes involved in ribosome and mitochondria function, thus suggesting rapid alterations in protein production and cellular energy supply. At later stages, between 24 and 48 hours after infection, the expression of genes involved in metabolic processes—in particular, those related to xenobiotic metabolism—was decreased. Mathematical modeling incorporating SARS-CoV-2 replication suggested that SARS-CoV-2 proteins inhibited the host antiviral response and that virus transcripts exceeded the translation capacity of the host cells. Targeting kinase-dependent pathways that exhibited increases in transcription in host cells was as effective as a virus-targeted inhibitor at repressing viral replication. Our findings in this model system delineate a sequence of SARS-CoV-2 virus-host interactions that may facilitate the identification of druggable host pathways to suppress infection.","2023-09-26","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 02:39:07","eabl8266","","804","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/BV3NGFAZ/Adam et al. - 2023 - Transcriptomics-inferred dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in.pdf","","Log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simply making contact with a glass probe induced calcium (Ca2+) fluxes in B cells that were blocked by the Piezo1 inhibitor GsMTx4. When placed on glass surfaces, the plasma membrane tension of B cells increased, which stimulated Ca2+ influx and spreading of B cells over the glass surface, which was blocked by the Piezo1 inhibitor OB-1. B cell responses to membrane-presented antigens but not to soluble antigens were inhibited both by Piezo1 inhibitors and by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Piezo1.

MIR99AHG was abundant in invasive CRC cells and metastatic tumors from patients and promoted motility and invasion in cultured CRC cells. MIR99AHG bound to and stabilized the RNA splicing factor PTBP1, and this complex increased cassette exon inclusion in the mRNA encoding the chromatin remodeling gene SMARCA1. Specifically, MIR99AHG altered the nature of PTBP1 binding to the splice sites on intron 12 of SMARCA1 pre-mRNA, thereby triggering a splicing switch from skipping to including exon 13 to produce the long isoform, SMARCA1-L. SMARCA1, but not SMARCA1-L, suppressed invadopodia formation, cell migration, and invasion. Analysis of CRC samples revealed that the abundance of MIR99AHG transcript positively correlated with that of SMARCA1-L mRNA and PTBP1 protein and with poor prognosis in patients with CRC. Furthermore, TGF-β1 secretion from cancer-associated fibroblasts increased MIR99AHG expression in CRC cells.

Here, we investigated whether TSLP contributes to allergic inflammation by directly stimulating human CD4+ T cells and whether this process is operational in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a disease linked to variants in TSLP. We showed that about 10% of esophageal-derived memory CD4+ T cells from individuals with EoE and less than 3% of cells from control individuals expressed the receptor for TSLP and directly responded to TSLP, as determined by measuring the phosphorylation of STAT5, a transcription factor activated downstream of TSLP stimulation. Accordingly, increased numbers of TSLP-responsive memory CD4+ T cells were present in the circulation of individuals with EoE. TSLP increased the proliferation of CD4+ T cells, enhanced type 2 cytokine production, induced the increased abundance of its own receptor, and modified the expression of 212 genes. The epigenetic response to TSLP was associated with an enrichment in BATF and IRF4 chromatin-binding sites, and these transcription factors were induced by TSLP, providing a feed-forward loop. The numbers of circulating and esophageal CD4+ T cells responsive to TSLP correlated with the numbers of esophageal eosinophils, supporting a potential functional role for TSLP in driving the pathogenesis of EoE and providing the basis for a blood-based diagnostic test based on the extent of TSLP-induced STAT5 phosphorylation in circulating CD4+ T cells.

We identified 1869 Kla sites in 469 proteins under these two conditions, with the biofilm growth state showing a greater number of lactylated sites and proteins. Although high sugar increased Kla globally, it reduced lactylation of RNA polymerase subunit α (RpoA) at Lys173. Lactylation at this residue inhibited the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides, a major constituent of the cariogenic biofilm. The Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily enzyme GNAT13 exhibited lysine lactyltransferase activity in cells and lactylated Lys173 in RpoA in vitro.

A genetic screen showed that the degradation of LIN-45 required the E3/E4 ubiquitin ligase UFD-2. Both UFD-2 and its partner, the ATP-dependent segregase CDC-48, were required for the developmental regulation of LIN-45 protein abundance. We showed that UFD-2 acted in the same pathway as the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFSEL-10 to decrease LIN-45 abundance in cells in which Raf-MEK-ERK signaling was most highly active. UFD-2 also reduced the protein abundance of activated LIN-45 carrying a mutation equivalent to the cancer-associated BRAF(V600E) variant. Our structure-function studies showed that the disruption of LIN-45 domains that mediate protein-protein interactions, including the conserved cysteine-rich domain and 14-3-3 binding motifs, were required for UFD-2–independent degradation of LIN-45. We propose a model in which UFD-2 and CDC-48 act downstream of SCFSEL-10 to remove LIN-45 from its protein interaction partners and facilitate proteasomal targeting and degradation.

Therapy-resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are the primary cause of relapse in patients with chronic and acute myeloid leukemia (CML and AML). However, the same signaling pathways frequently support stemness in both LSCs and normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), making LSCs difficult to therapeutically target. In cell lines and patient samples, we found that interleukin-33 (IL-33) signaling promoted stemness only in leukemia cells in a subtype-specific manner. The IL-33 receptor ST2 was abundant on the surfaces of CD34+ BCR/ABL1 CML and CD34+ AML cells harboring AML1/ETO and DEK/NUP214 translocations or deletion of chromosome 9q [del(9q)]. The cell surface abundance of ST2, which was lower or absent on other leukemia subtypes and HSCs, correlated with stemness, activated Wnt signaling, and repressed Notch signaling. IL-33–ST2 signaling promoted the maintenance and expansion of AML1/ETO–, DEK/NUP214–, and BCR/ABL1–positive LSCs in culture and in mice by activating Wnt, MAPK, and NF-κB signaling. Wnt signaling and its inhibition of the Notch pathway up-regulated the expression of the gene encoding ST2, thus forming a cell-autonomous loop. IL-33–ST2 signaling promoted the resistance of CML cells to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) nilotinib and of AML cells to standard chemotherapy. Thus, inhibiting IL-33–ST2 signaling may target LSCs to overcome resistance to chemotherapy or TKIs in these subtypes of leukemia.","2023-08-29","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 02:39:18","eadd7705","","800","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/TUKRVCMK/Naef et al. - 2023 - IL-33–ST2 signaling promotes stemness in subtypes .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Enhanced S1P signaling promoted glioblastoma cell proliferation and survival by activating the kinases AKT and CHK1 and the transcriptional regulators cMYC and STAT3 and by increasing the abundance of cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), driving several feed-forward signaling loops. Inhibition of S1P signaling abrogated the proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects of US28. US28 also activated the S1P signaling axis in HCMV-infected cells. This study uncovers central roles for S1P and CIP2A in feed-forward signaling that contributes to the US28-mediated exacerbation of glioblastoma.","2023-08-15","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 02:39:23","eade6737","","798","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/CDUCPHVC/Bergkamp et al. - 2023 - A virally encoded GPCR drives glioblastoma through.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We showed that the cytokine TGF-β (transforming growth factor–β) regulates glycolysis in macrophages independently of inflammatory cytokine production and affects survival in mouse models of sepsis. During macrophage activation, TGF-β increased the expression and activity of the glycolytic enzyme PFKL (phosphofructokinase-1 liver type) and promoted glycolysis but suppressed the production of proinflammatory cytokines. The increase in glycolysis was mediated by an mTOR–c-MYC–dependent pathway, whereas the inhibition of cytokine production was due to activation of the transcriptional coactivator SMAD3 and suppression of the activity of the proinflammatory transcription factors AP-1, NF-κB, and STAT1. In mice with LPS-induced endotoxemia and experimentally induced sepsis, the TGF-β–induced enhancement in macrophage glycolysis led to decreased survival, which was associated with increased blood coagulation. Analysis of septic patient cohorts revealed that the expression of PFKL, TGFBRI (which encodes a TGF-β receptor), and F13A1 (which encodes a coagulation factor) in myeloid cells positively correlated with COVID-19 disease.

To map the location and timing of the individual steps required for the proteolysis and movement of Notch from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, we used proximity labeling with quantitative, multiplexed mass spectrometry to monitor the interaction partners of endogenous NOTCH2 after ligand stimulation in the presence of a γ-secretase inhibitor and as a function of time after inhibitor removal.

The synaptic effects of two mechanisms that induce CaMKII autonomy are well studied: autophosphorylation at threonine-286 and binding to GluN2B. Here, we examined the neuronal functions of additional autonomy mechanisms: nitrosylation and oxidation of the CaMKII regulatory domain. We generated a knock-in mouse line with mutations that render the CaMKII regulatory domain nitrosylation/oxidation-incompetent, CaMKIIΔSNO, and found that it had deficits in memory and synaptic plasticity that were similar to those in aged wild-type mice. In addition, similar to aged wild-type mice, in which CaMKII was hyponitrosylated, but unlike mice with impairments of other CaMKII autonomy mechanisms, CaMKIIΔSNO mice showed reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) when induced by theta-burst stimulation but not high-frequency stimulation (HFS). As in aged wild-type mice, the HFS-LTP in the young adult CaMKIIΔSNO mice required L-type voltage-gated calcium ion channels. The effects in aged mice were likely caused by the loss of nitrosylation because no decline in CaMKII oxidation was detected. In hippocampal neurons, nitrosylation of CaMKII induced its accumulation at synapses under basal conditions in a manner mediated by GluN2B binding, like after LTP stimuli. However, LTP-induced synaptic CaMKII accumulation did not require nitrosylation. Thus, an aging-associated decrease in CaMKII nitrosylation may cause impairments by chronic synaptic effects, such as the decrease in basal synaptic CaMKII.","2023-07-25","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 02:40:03","eade5892","","795","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/GKNMXBB2/Rumian et al. - 2023 - Decreased nitrosylation of CaMKII causes aging-ass.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CagA promotes gastric carcinogenesis through interactions with multiple host proteins. Here, we show that CagA also disrupts Wnt-dependent planar cell polarity (Wnt/PCP), which orients cells within the plane of an epithelium and coordinates collective cell behaviors such as convergent extension to enable epithelial elongation during development. Ectopic expression of CagA in Xenopus laevis embryos impaired gastrulation, neural tube formation, and axis elongation, processes driven by convergent extension movements that depend on the Wnt/PCP pathway. Mice specifically expressing CagA in the stomach epithelium had longer pyloric glands and mislocalization of the tetraspanin proteins VANGL1 and VANGL2 (VANGL1/2), which are critical components of Wnt/PCP signaling. The increased pyloric gland length was due to hyperproliferation of cells at the gland base, where Lgr5+ stem and progenitor cells reside, and was associated with fewer differentiated enteroendocrine cells. In cultured human gastric epithelial cells, the N terminus of CagA interacted with the C-terminal cytoplasmic tails of VANGL1/2, which impaired Wnt/PCP signaling by inducing the mislocalization of VANGL1/2 from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm. Thus, CagA may contribute to the development of gastric cancer by subverting a Wnt/PCP-dependent mechanism that restrains pyloric gland stem cell proliferation and promotes enteroendocrine differentiation.","2023-07-18","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 02:40:05","eabp9020","","794","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/QMHXJERP/Takahashi-Kanemitsu et al. - 2023 - The Helicobacter pylori CagA oncoprotein disrupts .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Expression of nuclear-localized ERK2 constructs in serum-starved cells revealed that ERK2 in the nucleus—regardless of its kinase activity—increased MYC mRNA expression and MYC protein abundance. ERK2 bound to the promoter through its amino-terminal insert domain and to the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK9 (which activates RNA polymerase II) through its carboxyl-terminal conserved docking domain. Both interactions were essential for ERK2-induced MYC expression, and depleting ERK impaired CDK9 occupancy and RNA polymerase II progression at the MYC promoter. Artificially tethering CDK9 to the MYC promoter by fusing it to the ERK2 insert domain was sufficient to stimulate MYC expression in serum-starved cells.

The same mutations also reduced recruitment of RPTPα to actin-rich structures and inhibited SRC activation and cellular migration. An antibody against the RPTPα ectodomain that prevented the clustering of RPTPα also inhibited RPTPα-SRC association and SRC activation and attenuated fibroblast migration and joint damage in arthritic mice.

In dividing neuroblasts from Drosophila melanogaster, we observed that immediately before cleavage, first centralspindlin and then RhoGEF localized to the sites where cleavage subsequently initiated. Using in vitro assays with purified Drosophila proteins and stabilized microtubules, we found that centralspindlin directly transported RhoGEF as cargo along single microtubules and sequestered it at microtubule plus-ends for prolonged periods of time. In addition, the binding of RhoGEF to centralspindlin appeared to stimulate centralspindlin motor activity. Thus, the motor activity and microtubule association of centralspindlin can translocate RhoGEF to areas where microtubule plus-ends are abundant, such as at overlapping astral microtubules, to locally activate RhoA and accurately position the cleavage plane during cell division.","2023-07-04","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 02:40:17","eadh0601","","792","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/UZ45KSX8/Warecki and Tao - 2023 - Centralspindlin-mediated transport of RhoGEF posit.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found that XBP1 was required for TIM4 mRNA and protein expression in airway DCs in response to the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and that this pathway was required for TIM4 expression on DCs in response to the allergens PM2.5 and Derf1. The IL-2–XBP1–TIM4 axis in DCs contributed to Derf1/PM2.5-induced, aberrant TH2 cell responses in vivo. An interaction between the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Son of sevenless-1 (SOS1) and the GTPase RAS promoted XBP1 and TIM4 production in DCs. Targeting the XBP1-TIM4 pathway in DCs prevented or alleviated experimental airway allergy. Together, these data suggest that XBP1 is required for TH2 cell responses by inducing the development of TIM4+ DCs, which depends on the IL-2–XBP1–SOS1 axis. This signaling pathway provides potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of TH2 cell–dependent inflammation or allergic diseases.","2023-06-27","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 02:40:19","eabm9454","","791","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/7ILXTXGJ/Yang et al. - 2023 - The transcription factor XBP1 in dendritic cells p.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inducible deletion of Rela (which encodes the NF-κB p65 subunit) in mature CD4+ T cells also resulted in loss of naïve CD4+ T cells and in reduced abundance of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) encoded by the NF-κB target Il7r, revealing an additional reliance upon NF-κB for the long-term survival of mature T cells.

Adhesion to the ECM proteins collagen IV and laminin-1 increased the number of Ca2+ microdomains in a manner dependent on the kinase FAK, phospholipase C (PLC), and all three inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) subtypes and promoted the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFAT-1. Mathematical modeling predicted that the formation of adhesion-dependent Ca2+ microdomains required the concerted activity of two to six IP3Rs and ORAI1 channels to achieve the increase in the Ca2+ concentration in the ER–plasma membrane junction that was observed experimentally and that required SOCE. Further, adhesion-dependent Ca2+ microdomains were important for the magnitude of the TCR-induced activation of T cells on collagen IV as assessed by the global Ca2+ response and NFAT-1 nuclear translocation.

SMAD7 inhibits signaling through the pathway by promoting the polyubiquitination of the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI). We identified an unannotated nuclear long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that we designated LETS1 (lncRNA enforcing TGF-β signaling 1) that was not only increased but also perpetuated by TGF-β signaling. Loss of LETS1 attenuated TGF-β–induced EMT and migration in breast and lung cancer cells in vitro and extravasation of the cells in a zebrafish xenograft model. LETS1 potentiated TGF-β–SMAD signaling by stabilizing cell surface TβRI, thereby forming a positive feedback loop. Specifically, LETS1 inhibited TβRI polyubiquitination by binding to nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT5) and inducing the expression of the gene encoding the orphan nuclear receptor 4A1 (NR4A1), a component of a destruction complex for SMAD7.

Leveraging the golden hamster model of COVID-19, we sought to understand the dynamics between SARS-CoV-2 infection in the airways and the systemic host response that ensues. We found that early SARS-CoV-2 replication was largely confined to the respiratory tract and olfactory system and, to a lesser extent, the heart and gastrointestinal tract but generated a host antiviral response in every organ as a result of circulating type I and III interferons. Moreover, we showed that diminishing the response in the airways by immunosuppression or administration of SARS-CoV-2 intravenously resulted in decreased immune priming, viremia, and increased viral tropism, including productive infection of the liver, kidney, spleen, and brain. Last, we showed that productive infection of the airways was required for mounting an effective and system-wide antiviral response. Together, these data illustrate how COVID-19 can result in diverse clinical presentations in which disease outcomes can be a by-product of the speed and strength of immune engagement. These studies provide additional evidence for the mechanistic basis of the diverse clinical presentations of COVID-19 and highlight the ability of the respiratory tract to generate a systemic immune defense after pathogen recognition.","2023-06-13","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 02:40:50","eadg5470","","789","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/UZIIH38I/Carrau et al. - 2023 - Delayed engagement of host defenses enables SARS-C.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Brain swelling is linked to the influx of water into perivascular astrocytes through channels called aquaporins. Water accumulation in astrocytes increases their volume, which contributes to brain swelling. Using a mouse model of severe ischemic stroke, we identified a potentially targetable mechanism that promoted the cell surface localization of aquaporin 4 (AQP4) in perivascular astrocytic endfeet, which completely ensheathe the brain’s capillaries. Cerebral ischemia increased the abundance of the heteromeric cation channel SUR1-TRPM4 and of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger NCX1 in the endfeet of perivascular astrocytes. The influx of Na+ through SUR1-TRPM4 induced Ca2+ transport into cells through NCX1 operating in reverse mode, thus raising the intra-endfoot concentration of Ca2+. This increase in Ca2+ stimulated calmodulin-dependent translocation of AQP4 to the plasma membrane and water influx, which led to cellular edema and brain swelling. Pharmacological inhibition or astrocyte-specific deletion of SUR1-TRPM4 or NCX1 reduced brain swelling and improved neurological function in mice to a similar extent as an AQP4 inhibitor and was independent of infarct size. Thus, channels in astrocyte endfeet could be targeted to reduce postischemic brain swelling in stroke patients.","2023-06-06","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 02:40:55","eadd6364","","788","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/HV42BCFB/Stokum et al. - 2023 - Cation flux through SUR1-TRPM4 and NCX1 in astrocy.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During regeneration after partial hepatectomy, Uhrf2 expression increased in an FGFR-dependent manner, and Uhrf2 was more abundant in the nuclei of liver cells in control mice compared with FGFR-deficient mice. Hepatocyte-specific Uhrf2 knockout or nanoparticle-mediated Uhrf2 knockdown caused extensive liver necrosis and impaired hepatocyte proliferation after partial hepatectomy, resulting in liver failure. In cultured hepatocytes, Uhrf2 interacted with several chromatin remodeling proteins and suppressed the expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes. In vivo, the loss of Uhrf2 resulted in cholesterol and bile acid accumulation in the liver during regeneration. Treatment with a bile acid scavenger rescued the necrotic phenotype, hepatocyte proliferation, and the regenerative capacity of the liver in Uhrf2-deficient mice subjected to partial hepatectomy.

PCA reduced the intracellular amounts of microRNA-10b (miR-10b) by promoting its secretion in extracellular vesicles, which led to an increase in the abundance of the miR-10b target Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4). In turn, KLF4 transcriptionally induced the gene encoding Mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK), an efferocytic receptor for the recognition of apoptotic cells, resulting in increased continual efferocytic capacity. However, in naive macrophages, the PCA-induced secretion of miR-10b did not affect KLF4 and MerTK protein abundance or efferocytic capacity. In mice, oral administration of PCA increased continual efferocytosis in macrophages residing in the peritoneal cavities, thymi, and advanced atherosclerotic plaques through the miR-10b–KLF4–MerTK pathway. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of miR-10b with antagomiR-10b also increased the efferocytic capacity of efferocytic but not naive macrophages in vitro and in vivo.

Symptoms of B. cereus ingestion depend on the production of various toxins that target the gastric and intestinal epithelia. From a screen of bacterial isolates from human stool samples that compromised intestinal barrier function in mice, we identified a strain of B. cereus that disrupted tight and adherens junctions in the intestinal epithelium. This activity was mediated by the pore-forming exotoxin alveolysin, which increased the production of the membrane-anchored protein CD59 and of cilia- and flagella-associated protein 100 (CFAP100) in intestinal epithelial cells. In vitro, CFAP100 interacted with microtubules and promoted microtubule polymerization. CFAP100 overexpression stabilized microtubules in intestinal epithelial cells, leading to disorganization of the microtubule network and perturbation of tight and adherens junctions. The disruption of cell junctions by alveolysin depended on the increase in CFAP100, which in turn depended on CD59 and the activation of PI3K-AKT signaling. These findings demonstrate that, in addition to forming membrane pores, B. cereus alveolysin can permeabilize the intestinal epithelium by disrupting epithelial cell junctions in a manner that is consistent with intestinal symptoms and may allow the bacteria to escape the intestine and cause systemic infections. Our results suggest the potential value of targeting alveolysin or CFAP100 to prevent B. cereus–associated intestinal diseases and systemic infections.","2023-05-16","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 02:41:01","eade8111","","785","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/UY5UHCP7/Sun et al. - 2023 - The Bacillus cereus toxin alveolysin disrupts the .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the SHP1 activation model, THEMIS is proposed to enhance the activity of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 (encoded by Ptpn6), thereby dampening T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling and preventing the inappropriate negative selection of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes by positively selecting ligands. In contrast, in the SHP1 inhibition model, THEMIS is proposed to suppress SHP1 activity, rendering CD4+CD8+ thymocytes more sensitive to TCR signaling initiated by low-affinity ligands to promote positive selection. We sought to resolve the controversy regarding the molecular function of THEMIS. We found that the defect in positive selection in Themis−/− thymocytes was ameliorated by pharmacologic inhibition of SHP1 or by deletion of Ptpn6 and was exacerbated by SHP1 overexpression. Moreover, overexpression of SHP1 phenocopied the Themis−/− developmental defect, whereas deletion of Ptpn6, Ptpn11 (encoding SHP2), or both did not result in a phenotype resembling that of Themis deficiency. Last, we found that thymocyte negative selection was not enhanced but was instead impaired in the absence of THEMIS. Together, these results provide evidence favoring the SHP1 inhibition model, supporting a mechanism whereby THEMIS functions to enhance the sensitivity of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes to TCR signaling, enabling positive selection by low-affinity, self-ligand–TCR interactions.","2023-05-09","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 02:41:02","eade1274","","784","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/7MQ6SCCP/Choi et al. - 2023 - THEMIS increases TCR signaling in CD4+CD8+ thymocy.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We detected SARS-CoV-2 transcripts but no infectious material in the cervical and thoracic spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) within the first 24 hours of intranasal virus infection. SARS-CoV-2–infected hamsters exhibited mechanical hypersensitivity that was milder but prolonged compared with that observed in IAV-infected hamsters. RNA sequencing analysis of thoracic DRGs 1 to 4 days after infection suggested perturbations in predominantly neuronal signaling in SARS-CoV-2–infected animals as opposed to type I interferon signaling in IAV-infected animals. Later, 31 days after infection, a neuropathic transcriptome emerged in thoracic DRGs from SARS-CoV-2–infected animals, which coincided with SARS-CoV-2–specific mechanical hypersensitivity.

The papain-like proteases (PLPs) of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63 function in viral innate immune evasion and have deubiquitinating (DUB) and deISGylating activities. We identified the PLPs of HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-OC43 and found that their enzymatic properties correlated with their ability to suppress innate immune responses. A conserved noncatalytic aspartic acid residue was critical for both DUB and deISGylating activities, but the PLPs had differing ubiquitin (Ub) chain cleavage selectivities and binding affinities for Ub, K48-linked diUb, and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) substrates. The crystal structure of HKU1-PLP2 in complex with Ub revealed binding interfaces that accounted for the unusually high binding affinity between this PLP and Ub. In cellular assays, the PLPs from the severe disease–causing coronaviruses strongly suppressed innate immune IFN-I and NF-κB signaling and stimulated autophagy, whereas the PLPs from the mild disease–causing coronaviruses generally showed weaker effects on immune suppression and autophagy induction. In addition, a PLP from a SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern showed increased suppression of innate immune signaling pathways.

Using proteomic and cellular imaging techniques, we found that MICU1 localized to the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) and directly interacted with the MICOS components MIC60 and CHCHD2 independently of the mtCU. We demonstrated that MICU1 was essential for MICOS complex formation and that MICU1 ablation resulted in altered cristae organization, mitochondrial ultrastructure, mitochondrial membrane dynamics, and cell death signaling.

Here, we found that NK cell tolerance and education were determined by the subcellular localization of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. In mice lacking MHC-I molecules, uneducated, self-tolerant Ly49A+ NK cells showed accumulation of SHP-1 in the activating immune synapse, where it colocalized with F-actin and the signaling adaptor protein SLP-76. Education of Ly49A+ NK cells by the MHC-I molecule H2Dd led to reduced synaptic accumulation of SHP-1, accompanied by augmented signaling from activating receptors. Education was also linked to reduced transcription of Ptpn6, which encodes SHP-1. Moreover, synaptic SHP-1 accumulation was reduced in NK cells carrying the H2Dd-educated receptor Ly49G2 but not in those carrying the noneducating receptor Ly49I. Colocalization of Ly49A and SHP-1 outside of the synapse was more frequent in educated compared with uneducated NK cells, suggesting a role for Ly49A in preventing synaptic SHP-1 accumulation in NK cell education.

We previously reported that inhibiting the chaperone protein HSP90 in the spinal cords of mice promotes the antinociceptive effects of opioids in a manner that involved increased activation of the kinase ERK. Here, we found that the underlying mechanism involves the relief of a negative feedback loop mediated by the kinase AMPK. Intrathecal treatment of male and female mice with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG decreased the abundance of the β1 subunit of AMPK in the spinal cord. The antinociceptive effects of 17-AAG with morphine were suppressed by intrathecal administration of AMPK activators and enhanced by an AMPK inhibitor. Opioid treatment increased the abundance of phosphorylated AMPK in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where it colocalized with a neuronal marker and the neuropeptide CGRP. Knocking down AMPK in CGRP-positive neurons enhanced the antinociceptive effects of morphine and demonstrated that AMPK mediated the signal transduction between HSP90 inhibition and ERK activation. These data suggest that AMPK mediates an opioid-induced negative feedback loop in CGRP neurons of the spinal cord and that this loop can be disabled by HSP90 inhibition to enhance the efficacy of opioids.","2023-04-11","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 05:59:36","eade2438","","780","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/73HHQI2E/Gabriel and Streicher - 2023 - HSP90 inhibition in the mouse spinal cord enhances.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the mechanisms underlying GPR183 internalization and the role of internalization in the main biological function of the receptor, chemotaxis. We found that the C terminus of the receptor was important for ligand-induced internalization but less so for constitutive (ligand-independent) internalization. β-arrestin potentiated ligand-induced internalization but was not required for ligand-induced or constitutive internalization. Caveolin and dynamin were the main mediators of both constitutive and ligand-induced receptor internalization in a mechanism independent of G protein activation. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis also contributed to constitutive GPR183 internalization in a β-arrestin–independent manner, suggesting the existence of different pools of surface-localized GPR183.

We demonstrated that the endocytosis of β2AR phosphorylated by GPCR kinases (GRKs) mediated arrestin3-dependent nuclear export of PDE4D5, which was critical for promoting nuclear cAMP signaling and gene expression in hippocampal neurons for memory consolidation. Inhibition of the arrestin3-PDE4D5 association prevented β2AR-induced nuclear cAMP signaling without affecting receptor endocytosis. Direct PDE4 inhibition rescued β2AR-induced nuclear cAMP signaling and ameliorated memory deficits in mice expressing a form of the β2AR that could not be phosphorylated by GRKs. These data reveal how β2AR phosphorylated by endosomal GRK promotes the nuclear export of PDE4D5, leading to nuclear cAMP signaling, changes in gene expression, and memory consolidation.

IL-33 abundance was overall decreased but more frequently localized to the nucleus in patient HCC tissues than in normal liver tissues. In human and mouse HCC cells in culture and in vivo, IL-33 overexpression inhibited proliferation and repressed the abundance of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) at the transcriptional level by promoting the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). However, this interaction was disrupted by SUMOylation of IL-33 at Lys54 mediated by the E3 ligase RanBP2. IL-33 SUMOylation correlated with its nuclear localization in HCC cells and tumors. An increase in SUMOylated IL-33 in HCC cells in cocultures and in vivo stabilized IRF1 and increased PD-L1 abundance and chemokine IL-8 secretion, which prevented the activation of cytotoxic T cells and promoted the M2 polarization of macrophages, respectively.

Chronological tracing of transcriptomic and epigenetic changes upon stimulation revealed that Dectin-2 induced early and strong signaling, whereas Mincle-mediated signaling was delayed, which reflects their expression patterns. Generation of early and strong FcRγ-Syk signaling by engineered chimeric receptors was sufficient to recapitulate a Dectin-2–like gene expression profile. Early Syk signaling selectively stimulated the activity of the calcium ion–activated transcription factor NFAT, which rapidly altered the chromatin status and transcription of the Il2 gene. In contrast, proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, were induced regardless of FcRγ signaling kinetics.

In uveal melanoma, a conserved glutamine residue critical for GTP hydrolysis in the G protein α subunit is often mutated in Gαq or Gα11 to either leucine or proline. In contrast, other glutamine mutations or mutations in other Gα subtypes are rare. To uncover the mechanism of the genetic selection and the functional role of this glutamine residue, we analyzed all possible substitutions of this residue in multiple Gα isoforms. Through cell-based measurements of activity, we showed that some mutants were further activated and inactivated by G protein–coupled receptors. Through biochemical, molecular dynamics, and nuclear magnetic resonance–based structural studies, we showed that the Gα mutants were functionally distinct and conformationally diverse, despite their shared inability to hydrolyze GTP. Thus, the catalytic glutamine residue contributes to functions beyond GTP hydrolysis, and these functions include subtype-specific, allosteric modulation of receptor-mediated subunit dissociation.

Likewise, the protein α-synuclein regulates vesicle trafficking, and its abnormal aggregation in neurons is the defining cytopathology of PD. Because of their functional similarities in the same disease context, we investigated whether the two proteins were connected. We found that Syt11 was palmitoylated in mouse and human brain tissue and in cultured cortical neurons and that this modification to Syt11 disrupted α-synuclein homeostasis in neurons. Palmitoylation of two cysteines adjacent to the transmembrane domain, Cys39 and Cys40, localized Syt11 to digitonin-insoluble portions of intracellular membranes and protected it from degradation by the endolysosomal system. In neurons, palmitoylation of Syt11 increased its abundance and enhanced the binding of α-synuclein to intracellular membranes. As a result, the abundance of the physiologic tetrameric form of α-synuclein was decreased, and that of its aggregation-prone monomeric form was increased. These effects were replicated by overexpression of wild-type Syt11 but not a palmitoylation-deficient mutant.

Wnt signaling converts TCF from a transcriptional repressor to an activator in a process facilitated by the E3 ligase XIAP. XIAP-mediated monoubiquitylation of the transcriptional corepressor Groucho (also known as TLE) decreases its affinity for TCF, thereby allowing the transcriptional coactivator β-catenin to displace it on TCF. Through a genome-scale screen in cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells, we identified the deubiquitylase USP47 as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling. We found that USP47 was required for Wnt signaling during Drosophila and Xenopus laevis development, as well as in human cells, indicating evolutionary conservation. In human cells, knockdown of USP47 inhibited Wnt reporter activity, and USP47 acted downstream of the β-catenin destruction complex. USP47 interacted with TLE3 and XIAP but did not alter their amounts; however, knockdown of USP47 enhanced XIAP-mediated ubiquitylation of TLE3. USP47 inhibited ubiquitylation of TLE3 by XIAP in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that USP47 is the deubiquitylase that counteracts the E3 ligase activity of XIAP on TLE. Our data suggest a mechanism by which regulated ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation of TLE enhance the ability of β-catenin to cycle on and off TCF, thereby helping to ensure that the expression of Wnt target genes continues only as long as the upstream signal is present.","2023-02-07","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 05:59:50","eabn8372","","771","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/C2UEIZC3/Kassel et al. - 2023 - USP47 deubiquitylates GrouchoTLE to promote Wnt–β.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ER Ca2+ store depletion activates STIM1 by releasing the intramolecular “clamp” formed between the coiled coil 1 (CC1) and CC3 domains of the protein, enabling the C terminus to extend and interact with Orai1. The most frequently occurring mutation in patients with Stormorken syndrome is R304W, which destabilizes and extends the STIM1 C terminus independently of ER Ca2+ store depletion, causing constitutive binding to Orai1 and CRAC channel activation. We found that in cis deletion of one amino acid residue, Glu296 (which we called E296del) reversed the pathological effects of R304W. Homozygous Stim1 E296del+R304W mice were viable and phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type mice. NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and cellular experiments revealed that although the R304W mutation prevented CC1 from interacting with CC3, the additional deletion of Glu296 opposed this effect by enabling CC1-CC3 binding and restoring the CC domain interactions within STIM1 that are critical for proper CRAC channel function.

Similar to other G protein–coupled chemokine receptors, it promotes monocyte infiltration into tissues in response to the chemokine CCL2, and, like atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs), it scavenges chemokine from the extracellular environment. CCR2 therefore mediates CCL2-dependent signaling as a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) and also limits CCL2 signaling as a scavenger receptor. We investigated the mechanisms underlying CCR2 scavenging, including the involvement of intracellular proteins typically associated with GPCR signaling and internalization. Using CRISPR knockout cell lines, we showed that CCR2 scavenged by constitutively internalizing to remove CCL2 from the extracellular space and recycling back to the cell surface for further rounds of ligand sequestration. This process occurred independently of G proteins, GPCR kinases (GRKs), β-arrestins, and clathrin, which is distinct from other “professional” chemokine scavenger receptors that couple to GRKs, β-arrestins, or both.

Both Beclin homologs contributed to autophagosome formation, but a mechanism of autophagosome formation independent of either Beclin homolog occurred in response to starvation or mitochondrial damage. Mitophagy was compromised only in Beclin1-deficient HeLa cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts because of defective autophagosomal engulfment of mitochondria, and the function of Beclin1 in mitophagy required the phosphorylation of the conserved Ser15 residue by the kinase Ulk1. Mitochondria-ER–associated membranes (MAMs) are important sites of autophagosome formation during mitophagy, and Beclin1, but not Beclin2 or a Beclin1 mutant that could not be phosphorylated at Ser15, localized to MAMs during mitophagy.

Gasdermin D (GSDMD), which causes pyroptotic death in macrophages, is thought to be required for NET formation by neutrophils. Through experiments with known physiological activators of NET formation and ligands that activate canonical and noncanonical inflammasome signaling pathways, we demonstrated that Gsdmd-deficient mouse neutrophils were as competent as wild-type mouse neutrophils in producing NETs. Furthermore, GSDMD was not cleaved in wild-type neutrophils during NET release in response to inflammatory mediators. We found that activation of both canonical and noncanonical inflammasome signaling pathways resulted in GSDMD cleavage in wild-type neutrophils but was not associated with cell death.

We combined x-ray crystallography, hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations, and systems-integrative kinetic modeling approaches to study phosphoryl flow through the Bacillus subtilis thermosensing TCS DesK-DesR. The allosteric regulation of the histidine kinase DesK was critical to avoid back transfer of phosphoryl groups and futile phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles by isolating phosphatase, autokinase, and phosphotransferase activities. Interactions between the kinase’s ATP-binding domain and the regulator’s receiver domain placed the regulator in two distinct positions in the phosphotransferase and phosphatase complexes, thereby determining whether a key glutamine residue in DesK was properly situated to assist in the dephosphorylation reaction. Moreover, an energetically unfavorable phosphotransferase conformation when DesK was not phosphorylated minimized reverse phosphoryl transfer. DesR dimerization and a dissociative phosphoryl transfer reaction also enforced the direction of phosphoryl flow. Shorter or longer distances between the phosphoryl acceptor and donor residues shifted the phosphoryl transfer equilibrium by modulating the stabilizing effect of the Mg2+ cofactor. These mechanisms control the directionality of signal transmission and show how structure-encoded allostery stores and transmits information in signaling systems.","2023-01-24","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-06-11 00:41:30","2024-05-28 06:00:06","eabo7588","","769","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/JB5JNAFV/Lima et al. - 2023 - An allosteric switch ensures efficient unidirectio.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Serine-threonine kinases and phosphatases similar to those found in eukaryotes can fine-tune essential bacterial cellular processes, such as metabolism and stress signaling. We found that acid stress–mimicking conditions that S. aureus experiences in host tissues delayed growth, globally altered the serine and threonine phosphoproteome, and increased threonine phosphorylation of the activation loop of the serine-threonine protein kinase B (PknB). The deletion of stp, which encodes the only annotated functional serine-threonine phosphatase in S. aureus, increased the growth delay and phenotypic heterogeneity under different stress challenges, including growth in acidic conditions, the intracellular milieu of human cells, and abscesses in mice. This growth delay was associated with reduced protein translation and intracellular ATP concentrations and increased antibiotic tolerance. Using phosphopeptide enrichment and mass spectrometry–based proteomics, we identified targets of serine-threonine phosphorylation that may regulate bacterial growth and metabolism.

We found that TAOK1 was abundant in neurons in the mammalian brain and remodeled the neuronal plasma membrane through direct association with phosphoinositides. Our characterization of four NDD-associated TAOK1 mutations revealed that these mutants were catalytically inactive and were aberrantly trapped in a membrane-bound state, which induced abnormal membrane protrusions. Expression of these TAOK1 mutants in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons led to abnormal growth of the dendritic arbor. The coiled-coil region carboxyl-terminal to the kinase domain was predicted to fold into a triple helix, and this region directly bound phospholipids and was required for both membrane association and induction of aberrant protrusions. Autophosphorylation of threonine-440 and threonine-443 in the triple-helical region by the kinase domain blocked the plasma membrane association of TAOK1.
