ICIs are administered systemically in the clinic, however, reaching effective therapeutic dosing is challenging due to severe off-tumor toxicities. As such, intratumoral (IT) injection is increasingly investigated as an alternative delivery approach. However, repeated administration, which sometimes is invasive, is required due to rapid drug clearance from the tumor caused by increased interstitial fluid pressure. To minimize off-target drug biodistribution, we developed the nanofluidic drug-eluting seed (NDES) platform for sustained intratumoral release of therapeutic via molecular diffusion. Here we compared drug biodistribution between the NDES, intraperitoneal (IP) and intratumoral (IT) injection using fluorescently labeled PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (αPD-L1). We used two syngeneic TNBC murine models, EMT6 and 4T1, that differ in PD-L1 expression, immunogenicity, and transport phenotype. We investigated on-target (tumor) and off-target distribution using different treatment approaches. As radiotherapy is increasingly used in combination with immunotherapy, we sought to investigate its effect on αPD-L1 tumor accumulation and systemic distribution. The NDES-treated cohort displayed sustained levels of αPD-L1 in the tumor over the study period of 14 days with significantly lower off-target organ distribution, compared to the IP or IT injection. However, we observed differences in the biodistribution of αPD-L1 across tumor models and with radiation pretreatment. Thus, we sought to extensively characterize the tumor properties via histological analysis, diffusion evaluation and nanoparticles contrast-enhanced CT. Overall, we demonstrate that ICI delivery via NDES is an effective method for sustained on-target tumor delivery across tumor models and combination treatments.","2023","2024-04-22 18:19:18","2024-05-30 00:10:04","2024-04-22 18:19:18","e10594","","6","8","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2023 The Authors.

Distinguishing between sickle cell disease and trait is crucial during the diagnosis of sickle cell disease. While genetic analysis or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can accurately differentiate between these two genotypes, these tests are unsuitable for field use. Here, we report a novel microscopy-based diagnostic test called ShapeDx? to distinguish between disease and trait blood in less than 1?h. This is achieved by mixing an unknown blood sample with low and high concentrations of a chemical oxygen scavenger and thereby subjecting the blood to slow and fast hypoxia, respectively. The different rates of Hb polymerization resulting from slow and fast hypoxia lead to two distinct RBC shape distributions in the same blood sample, which allows us to identify it as healthy, trait, or disease. The controlled hypoxic environment necessary for differential Hb polymerization is generated using an imaging microchamber, which also reduces the sickling time of trait blood from several hours to just 30?min. In a single-blinded proof-of-concept study conducted on a small cohort of clinical samples, the results of the ShapeDx? test were 100% concordant with HPLC results. Additionally, our field studies have demonstrated that ShapeDx? is the first reported microscopy test capable of distinguishing between sickle cell disease and trait samples in resource-limited settings with the same accuracy as a gold standard test.","2023-12-27","2024-05-27 00:54:41","2024-05-29 23:56:53","2024-05-27 00:54:29","e10643","","n/a","n/a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/7GP7N6ZP/D'Costa et al. - 2023 - Differential sensitivity to hypoxia enables shape-.pdf; /Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/R5KJTNNN/btm2.html","","No bar","diagnostics; hemoglobin polymerization; RBC shape; shape-based classifier; sickle cell anemia; smartphone microscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although transplantation of exogenous Schwann cells (SCs) has been considered a promising treatment to promote nerve repair, this strategy has been hampered in practice by the limited availability of SC sources and an insufficient postengraftment cell retention rate. In this study, to address these challenges, SCs were aggregated into spheroids before being delivered to an injured rat sciatic nerve. We found that the three-dimensional aggregation of SCs induced their acquisition of a repair phenotype, as indicated by enhanced levels of c-Jun expression/activation and decreased expression of myelin sheath protein. Furthermore, our in vitro results demonstrated the superior potential of the SC spheroid-derived secretome in promoting neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglion neurons, enhancing the proliferation and migration of endogenous SCs, and recruiting macrophages. Moreover, transplantation of SC spheroids into rats after sciatic nerve transection effectively increased the postinjury nerve structure restoration and motor functional recovery rates, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of SC spheroids. In summary, transplantation of preassembled SC spheroids may hold great potential for enhancing the cell delivery efficiency and the resultant therapeutic outcome, thereby improving SC-based transplantation approaches for promoting peripheral nerve regeneration.","2024-03","2024-05-27 00:54:41","2024-05-29 23:54:59","2024-05-27 00:54:29","e10635","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/C9L9YNLC/Chen et al. - 2024 - Schwann cells acquire a repair phenotype after ass.pdf","","No problem","cell therapy; cell spheroid; peripheral nerve injury; regenerative medicine; Schwann cell","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Motivated by the ability of PBNP-PTT to potentiate endogenous immune responses, we recently demonstrated that PBNP-PTT could be used ex vivo to generate tumor-specific T cells against glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines as an adoptive T cell therapy (ATCT). In this study, we further developed this promising T cell development platform. First, we assessed the phenotype and function of T cells generated using PBNP-PTT. We observed that PBNP-PTT facilitated CD8+ T cell expansion from healthy donor PBMCs that secreted IFN? and TNFα and upregulated CD107a in response to engagement with target U87 cells, suggesting specific antitumor T cell activation and degranulation. Further, CD8+ effector and effector memory T cell populations significantly expanded after co-culture with U87 cells, consistent with tumor-specific effector responses. In orthotopically implanted U87 GBM tumors in vivo, PBNP-PTT-derived T cells effectively reduced U87 tumor growth and generated long-term survival in >80% of tumor-bearing mice by Day 100, compared to 0% of mice treated with PBS, non-specific T cells, or T cells expanded from lysed U87 cells, demonstrating an enhanced antitumor efficacy of this ATCT platform. Finally, we tested the generalizability of our approach by generating T cells targeting medulloblastoma (D556), breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), and acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cell lines.

However, frequent injections can be difficult for patients and may lead to various risks such as elevated intraocular pressure, infection, and retinal detachment. To address this issue, researchers have found that IVT injection of anti-VEGF proteins at their maximally viable concentration and dose can be an effective strategy. However, the intrinsic protein structure can limit the maximum concentration due to stability and solution viscosity. To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel anti-VEGF protein called nanoFc by fusing anti-VEGF nanobodies with a crystallizable fragment (Fc). NanoFc has demonstrated high binding affinity to VEGF165 through multivalency and potent bioactivity in various bioassays. Furthermore, nanoFc maintains satisfactory chemical and physical stability at 4°C over 1?month and is easily injectable at concentrations up to 200?mg/mL due to its unique architecture that yields a smaller shape factor. The design of nanoFc offers a bioengineering strategy to ensure both strong anti-VEGF binding affinity and high protein concentration, with the goal of reducing the frequency of IV injections.","2024-03","2024-05-27 00:54:41","2024-05-27 05:22:07","2024-05-27 00:54:31","e10632","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/BL3MULUI/Huang et al. - 2024 - A bioengineered anti-VEGF protein with high affini.pdf","","Zero","high concentration protein; intravitreal injection; multivalency; nanobody; protein engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This bioreactor consisted of a highly stretchable conductive membrane prepared by depositing polypyrrole (PPy) on a flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film. The tensile deformation of the PPy/PDMS membrane can be tuned by adjusting the channel depth. In addition, PPy/PDMS maintained its electrical conductivity under continuous cyclic stretching in the strain range of 6.5%?13% for 24?h. This device can be used to individually or simultaneously perform cyclic stretching and electrical stimulation. The results of single stimulation showed that either cyclic stretching or electrical stimulation upregulated myogenic gene expression and promoted myotube formation, where electrical stimulation improved better than cyclic stretching. However, only cyclic stretching can align C2C12 cells perpendicular to the stretching direction, and electrical stimulation did not affect cell morphology. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) immunostaining demonstrated that oriented cells under cyclic stretching resulted in parallel myotubes. The combination of these two stimuli exhibited synergetic effects on both myogenic gene regulation and myotube formation, and the incorporated electrical field did not affect the orientation effect of the cyclic stretching. These results suggested that these two treatments likely influenced cells through different pathways. Overall, the simultaneous application of cyclic stretching and electrical stimulation preserved both stimuli's advantages, so myo-differentiation can be highly improved to obtain abundant parallel myotubes, suggesting that our developed multifunctional bioreactor should benefit muscle tissue engineering applications.","2024-03","2024-05-27 00:54:41","2024-05-30 00:02:33","2024-05-27 00:54:33","e10633","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ZLNXG4JE/Hu et al. - 2024 - Development of a multifunctional bioreactor to eva.pdf","","No problem","bioreactor; cyclic stretching; electrical stimulation; myoblasts; myogenic differentiation; polydimethylsiloxane; polypyrrole","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there are no established methods that allow the three-dimensional visualization and quantification of pulmonary vascular permeability in vivo. Evans blue extravasation test and total protein test of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) are permeability assays commonly used in research settings. However, they lack the ability to identify the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of endothelial barrier disruption, which is typical in lung injuries. Magnetic resonance (MR) and near-infrared (NIR) imaging have been proposed to image pulmonary permeability, but suffer from limited sensitivity and penetration depth, respectively. In this study, we report the first use of magnetic particle imaging (MPI) to assess pulmonary vascular leakage noninvasively in vivo in mice. A dextran-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO), synomag?, was employed as the imaging tracer, and pulmonary SPIO extravasation was imaged and quantified to evaluate the vascular leakage. Animal models of acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis (PF) were used to validate the proposed method. MPI sensitively detected the SPIO extravasation in both acutely injured and fibrotic lungs in vivo, which was confirmed by ex vivo imaging and Prussian blue staining. Moreover, 3D MPI illustrated the spatial heterogeneity of vascular leakage, which correlated well with CT findings. Based on the in vivo 3D MPI images, we defined the SPIO extravasation index (SEI) to quantify the vascular leakage. A significant increase in SEI was observed in the injured lungs, in consistent with the results obtained via ex vivo permeability assays. Overall, our results demonstrate that 3D quantitative MPI serves as a useful tool to examine pulmonary vascular integrity in vivo, which shows promise for future clinical translation.","2024-03","2024-05-27 00:54:41","2024-05-29 23:58:37","2024-05-27 00:54:36","e10626","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/C82EPDLC/Feng et al. - 2024 - First magnetic particle imaging to assess pulmonar.pdf","","No problem","in vivo; lung injury; magnetic particle imaging; quantitative; vascular leakage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Teratomas serve as a model to mimic multilineage human development, thus enriching specific somatic progenitors and stem cells. Here, we discovered a small, condensed mass of MSCs within iPSC-generated teratomas. Afterward, we successfully isolated MSCs from this condensed mass, which was a byproduct of teratoma development. To evaluate the characteristics and cell behaviors of iPSC-derived MSCs (iPSC-MSCs), we conducted comprehensive assessments using qPCR, immunophenotype analysis, and cell proliferation-related assays. Remarkably, iPSC-MSCs exhibited an immunophenotype resembling that of conventional MSCs, and they displayed robust proliferative capabilities, similar to those of higher pluripotent stem cell-derived MSCs. Furthermore, iPSC-MSCs demonstrated the ability to differentiate into multiple lineages in vitro. Finally, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of iPSC-MSCs using an osteochondral defect model.

In this regard, numerous chemical modifications, which are not naturally observed in endogenous mRNA, have been implemented primarily to address the issue of immunogenicity and improve its biological performance. However, recent findings suggested pronounced differences between expression levels of IVT-mRNAs with different nucleoside modifications in transfected cells. Given the multistep process of IVT-mRNA delivery and subsequent intracellular expression, it is unclear which step is influenced by IVT-mRNA chemistry. Here, we deconvolute this process and show that the nucleoside modification does not interfere with complexation of carriers, their physicochemical properties, and extracellular stability, as exemplified by selected modifications. The immediate effect of mRNA chemistry on the efficiency of ribosomal protein synthesis as a contributor to differences in expression was quantified by in vitro cell-free translation. Our results demonstrate that for the nucleoside modifications tested, translatability was the decisive step in determining overall protein production.

Advances in functional imaging have opened the prospect of measuring IFP non-invasively. Image-based estimation of the IFP requires knowledge of the tissue hydraulic conductivity (K), a measure for the ease of bulk flow through the interstitium. However, data on the magnitude of K in human cancer tissue are not available. Methods We measured the hydraulic conductivity of tumor tissue using modified Ussing chambers in surgical resection specimens. The effect of the tumor microenvironment (TME) on K was investigated by quantifying the collagen content, cell density, and fibroblast density of the tested samples using quantitative immune histochemistry. Also, we developed a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to evaluate the role of K on interstitial fluid flow and drug transport in solid tumors. Results The results show that the hydraulic conductivity of human tumor tissues is very limited, ranging from approximately 10?15 to 10?14?m2/Pa∙s. Moreover, K values varied significantly between tumor types and between different samples from the same tumor. A significant inverse correlation was found between collagen fiber density and hydraulic conductivity values. However, no correlation was detected between K and cancer cell or fibroblast densities. The computational model demonstrated the impact of K on the interstitial fluid flow and the drug concentration profile: higher K values led to a lower IFP and deeper drug penetration. Conclusions Human tumor tissue is characterized by a very limited hydraulic conductivity, representing a barrier to effective drug transport. The results of this study can inform the development of realistic computational models, facilitate non-invasive IFP estimation, and contribute to stromal targeting anticancer therapies.","2024-03","2024-05-27 00:54:41","2024-05-27 01:02:27","2024-05-27 00:54:40","e10617","","2","9","","","Hydraulic conductivity of human cancer tissue","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/FV3TNIIX/Salavati et al. - 2024 - Hydraulic conductivity of human cancer tissue A h.pdf","","No bar","drug delivery; tissue engineering; chemical engineering-based bioprocessing; computational modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) enriched with N1-methylpseudouridine (m1?) modified transforming growth factor-?3 (TGF-?3) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA in promoting scar-free healing in preclinical models.

In a dorsal injury model, hADSCs loaded with modRNA TGF-?3 and IL-10 exhibited multidimensional therapeutic effects, including improved collagen deposition, extracellular matrix organization, and neovascularization. In vitro experiments confirmed the ability of these cells to markedly inhibit the proliferation and migration of keloid fibroblasts, and reverse the myofibroblast phenotype. Finally, collagen degradation mediated by matrix metalloproteinase upregulation was observed in an ex vivo keloid explant culture model.

The objective of this study was to develop a novel peripheral simulating bioreactor system to evaluate drug pharmacokinetics of stents. We utilized 3D-printed and off-the-shelf components to construct a peripheral-simulating bioreactor system capable of mimicking the motion of peripheral arteries. Servo motors were primarily used to shorten/elongate, twist, and bend explanted porcine carotid arteries. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics in the bioreactor, drug-eluting stents were deployed within explanted arteries and subjected to vascular motion along with pulsatile flow conditions. Following 30?min and 24?h, the arteries were removed, and paclitaxel levels were measured. Scanning electron microscopy was also performed to evaluate the stent surface. Arterial paclitaxel levels of the stent-treated arteries were found to be higher at 30?min than at 24?h following pulsatile and no vascular motion and even higher at 24?h following pulsatile flow and vascular motion. The residual drug on the stent significantly decreased from 30?min to 24?h. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the loss of paclitaxel coating at 24?h and greater disturbance in stents under peripheral motion versus pulsatile only. This system represents the first ex vivo system to determine the PK of drug-eluting stents under physiological flow and vascular motion conditions. This work provides a novel system for a quick and inexpensive preclinical tool to study acute drug tissue concentration kinetics of drug-releasing interventional vascular devices designed for peripheral applications.","2024-03","2024-05-27 00:55:12","2024-05-29 23:54:17","2024-05-27 00:55:02","e10618","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/W9SPW97V/Chen et al. - 2024 - Design and use of an ex vivo peripheral simulating.pdf","","No problem","drug delivery; pharmacokinetics; bioreactor; ex vivo; paclitaxel; peripheral arterial disease; stent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, intra-articular delivery of drugs to cartilage remains a challenge due to their rapid clearance within the joint. This problem is further exacerbated by the dense and negatively charged cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM). Cationic nanocarriers that form reversible electrostatic interactions with the anionic ECM can be an effective approach to overcome the electrostatic barrier presented by cartilage tissue. For an effective therapeutic outcome, the nanocarriers need to penetrate, accumulate, and be retained within the cartilage tissue. Nanocarriers that adhere quickly to cartilage tissue after intra-articular administration, transport through cartilage, and remain within its full thickness are crucial to the therapeutic outcome. To this end, we used ring-opening polymerization to synthesize branched poly(l-lysine) (BPL) cationic nanocarriers with varying numbers of poly(lysine) branches, surface charge, and functional groups, while maintaining similar hydrodynamic diameters. Our results show that the multivalent BPL molecules, including those that are highly branched (i.e., generation two), can readily adhere and transport through the full thickness of cartilage, healthy and degenerated, with prolonged intra-cartilage retention. Intra-articular injection of the BPL molecules in mouse knee joint explants and rat knee joints showed their localization and retention. In summary, this study describes an approach to design nanocarriers with varying charge and abundant functional groups while maintaining similar hydrodynamic diameters to aid the delivery of macromolecules to negatively charged tissues.","2023-10-16","2024-05-27 00:55:12","2024-05-30 00:00:58","2024-05-27 00:55:07","e10612","","n/a","n/a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/JNZUSVHP/Gonzales et al. - 2023 - Branched poly-l-lysine for cartilage penetrating c.pdf","","No problem","cartilage penetrating; cationic nanocarrier; intra-articular administration; osteoarthritis; poly-l-lysine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We recently revealed the important role of intracardiac EVs induced by myocardial ischemia/reperfusion on cardiac injury and dysfunction. However, the role of EVs isolated from normal tissues remains unclear. Here we found that EVs, derived from murine heart, lung, liver and kidney have similar effects on macrophages and regulate the inflammation, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis of macrophages. Interestingly, EV-treated macrophages showed LPS resistance with reduced expressions of inflammatory cytokines and enhanced phagocytic activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the protein content in EVs contributed to the activation of inflammation, while the RNA component mainly limited the excessive inflammatory response of macrophages to LPS. The enrichment of miRNAs, including miR-148a-3p, miR-1a-3p and miR-143-3p was confirmed in tissue EVs. These EV-enriched miRNAs contributed to the inflammation remission in LPS induced macrophages through multiple pathways, including STAT3, P65 and SAPK/JNK. Moreover, administration of both EVs and EV-educated macrophages attenuated septic injury and cytokine storm in murine CLP models. Taken together, the present study disclosed that EVs from normal tissues can orchestrate the homeostasis of macrophages and attenuate inflammatory injury of sepsis. Therefore, tissue derived EVs or their derivatives may serve as potential therapeutic strategies in inflammatory diseases.","2024-01","2024-05-27 00:55:12","2024-05-30 00:00:14","2024-05-27 00:55:07","e10609","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ASUJ9Q94/Ge et al. - 2024 - Extracellular vesicles from normal tissues orchest.pdf; /Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/AJ87IY2Q/btm2.html","","Zero","macrophage; microRNA; extracellular vesicles; immune homeostasis; sepsis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent findings have shown that activation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway can enhance natural immunity and increase lymphocyte infiltration into the TME, which presents a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we constructed hydroxyapatite nanoparticles co-loaded with curcumin and L-oxaliplatin (Cur/L-OHP@HAP NPs). We analyzed the particle-size distribution, zeta potential, spectral characteristics (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet?visible spectroscopy), and drug-release properties of the Cur/L-OHP@HAP NPs. The cellular uptake of the Cur/L-OHP@HAP NPs detected by flow cytometry and confocal laser-scanning microscopy. We comprehensively evaluated the anti-tumor properties and immune-activating effects of the NPs, both in vitro and in vivo. Physicochemical characterizations demonstrated that the Cur/L-OHP@HAP NPs were successfully synthesized and were capable of pH-dependent drug release. Notably, the Cur/L-OHP@HAP NPs efficiently entered cancer cells, after which the released L-OHP induced nuclear DNA (nDNA) damage to some extent. HAP promoted the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores in cancer cells, and curcumin inhibited Ca2+ efflux, resulting in intracellular Ca2+ overload and the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Damage to both nDNA and mtDNA greatly stimulated the cGAS-STING pathway, thereby activating natural immunity, accompanied by immune cell recruitment to the TME.

Using a lethal LPS-induced endotoxemia mouse model of sepsis, iNP-SAHA administration improved the survival of mice in a dose-dependent manner and tended to improve survival at the lowest doses compared to iNP control. Further, iNP-SAHA reduced the levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with sepsis more significantly than iNP and similarly improved inflammation-induced spleen and liver toxicity as iNP, supporting its potential polypharmacological activity.

Even with maximal treatment, patients show a low median survival and are often subjected to a high recurrence incidence. The currently available treatments require multimodal management, including maximal safe surgical resection, followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Because of the infiltrative glioblastoma nature, intraoperative differentiation of cancer tissue from normal brain parenchyma is very challenging, and this accounts for the low rate of complete tumor resection. For these reasons, clinicians have increasingly used various intraoperative adjuncts to improve surgical results, such as fluorescent agents. However, most of the existing fluorophores show several limitations such as poor selectivity, photostability, photosensitization and high costs. This could limit their application to successfully improve glioblastoma resection.

We aimed to distinguish the potential for metastatic disease from nonmetastatic disease at early times in triple-negative breast cancer using sister cell lines 4T1 (metastatic), 4T07 (invasive, nonmetastatic), and 67NR (nonmetastatic). We used a porous, polycaprolactone scaffold, that serves as an engineered metastatic niche, to identify metastatic disease through the characteristics of the microenvironment. Analysis of the immune cell composition at the scaffold was able to distinguish noninvasive 67NR tumor-bearing mice from 4T07 and 4T1 tumor-bearing mice but could not delineate metastatic potential between the two invasive cell lines. Gene expression in the scaffolds correlated with the up-regulation of cancer hallmarks (e.g., angiogenesis, hypoxia) in the 4T1 mice relative to 4T07 mice. We developed a 9-gene signature (Dhx9, Dusp12, Fth1, Ifitm1, Ndufs1, Pja2, Slc1a3, Soga1, Spon2) that successfully distinguished 4T1 disease from 67NR or 4T07 disease throughout metastatic progression.

Efficient drug delivery from the systemic circulation into the inner ear is limited by the blood-labyrinth-barrier (BLB). This study investigated a novel noninvasive sound conditioning (SC) strategy (90?dB SPL, 8?16?kHz, 2?h sound exposure) to temporally enhance BLB permeability in a controllable way, contributing to maximizing the penetration of pharmaceuticals from blood circulation into the cochlea. Trafficking of Fluorescein Isothiocyanate conjugated dextran and bovine serum albumin (FITC-dextran and FITC-BSA) demonstrated that paracellular leakage of BLB sustained for 6?h after SC, providing a controllable time window for systemic administration. Cochlear concentrations of dexamethasone (DEX) and dexamethasone phosphate (DEX-P), respectively transported by transcellular and paracellular pathways, showed a higher content of the latter one after SC, further confirming the key role of paracellular pathway in the SC-induced hyperpermeability. Results of high-throughput RNA-sequencing identified a series of tight junction (TJ)-associated genes after SC. The expressions of TJ (ZO-1) were reduced and irregular rearrangements of the junction were observed by transmission electron microscopy after SC. We further determined the inhibiting role of Rab13 in the recruitment of ZO-1 and later in the regulation of cellular permeability. Meanwhile, no significant change in the quantifications of endothelial caveolae vesicles after SC indicated that cellular transcytosis accounted little for the temporary hyperpermeability after SC. Based on these results, SC enhances the BLB permeability within 6?h and allows systemically applied drugs which tend to be transported by paracellular pathway to readily enter the inner ear, contributing to guiding the clinical medications on hearing loss.","2024-01","2024-05-27 00:55:42","2024-05-27 05:24:42","2024-05-27 00:55:32","e10596","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/VMKMI53D/Wang et al. - 2024 - Sound conditioning strategy promoting paracellular.pdf","","Zero","blood–labyrinth–barrier; hearing loss; permeability; sound conditioning; tight junctions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current treatment against CDI still relies on antibiotics, which also damage normal flora and increase the risk of CDI recurrence. Therefore, alternative therapies that are more effective against C. difficile bacteria and spores are urgently needed. Here, we designed an oxidation process using H2O2 containing PBS solution to generate Cl? and peroxide molecules that further process Ag and Au ions to form nanoboxes with Ag?Au peroxide coat covering Au shell and AgCl core (AgAu-based nanoboxes). The AgAu-based nanoboxes efficiently disrupted the membrane structure of bacteria/spores of C. difficile after 30?45?min exposure to the highly reactive Ag/Au peroxide surface of the nano structures. The Au-enclosed AgCl provided sustained suppression of the growth of 2???107 pathogenic Escherichia coli for up to 19?days. In a fecal bench ex vivo test and in vivo CDI murine model, biocompatibility and therapeutic efficacy of the AuAg nanoboxes to attenuate CDI was demonstrated by restoring the gut microbiota and colon mucosal structure. The treatment successfully rescued the CDI mice from death and prevented their recurrence mediated by vancomycin treatment. The significant outcomes indicated that the new peroxide-derived AgAu-based nanoboxes possess great potential for future translation into clinical application as a new alternative therapeutic strategy against CDI.","2023-11","2024-05-27 00:55:42","2024-05-30 01:06:23","2024-05-27 00:55:33","e10593","","6","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/3T3LC429/Yang et al. - 2023 - Novel metal peroxide nanoboxes restrain Clostridio.pdf","","No problem","AgAu; AgCl; Clostridioides difficile infection; peroxide; spore","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bone is the most common distant metastatic organ, worsening the quality of life and increasing the mortality of patients. Early detection of breast cancer bone metastasis is urgent for halting disease progression and improving tumor prognosis. Recently, extracellular matrix (ECM) with biomimetic tissue niches opened a new avenue for tumor models in vitro. Here, we developed a biomimetic decellularized ECM (dECM) system to recapitulate bone niches at different situations, bone mimetic dECM from osteoblasts (BM-ECM) and bone tumor mimetic dECM from osteosarcoma cells (OS-ECM). The two kinds of dECMs exhibited distinct morphology, protein composition, and distribution. Interestingly, highly metastatic breast cancer cells tended to adhere and migrate on BM-ECM, while lowly metastatic breast cancer cells preferred the OS-ECM niche. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition was a potential mechanism to initiate the breast cancer cell migration on different biomimetic dECMs. Importantly, in the nude mice model, the dECM system captured metastatic breast cancer cells as early as 10?days after orthotopic transplantation in mammary gland pads, with higher signal on BM-ECM than that on OS-ECM. Collectively, the biomimetic dECM system might be a promising tumor model to distinguish the metastatic ability of breast cancer cells in vitro and to facilitate early detection of metastatic breast cancer cells in vivo, contributing to the diagnosis of breast cancer bone metastasis.","2024-01","2024-05-27 00:55:42","2024-05-27 05:24:17","2024-05-27 00:55:34","e10597","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/XWZ4M2YE/Weng et al. - 2024 - Distinguished biomimetic dECM system facilitates e.pdf","","No problem","breast cancer bone metastasis; decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM); early metastatic diagnosis; in vitro tumor model; native niches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extensive network testing was conducted using diverse datasets, including an internal 4D-CT dataset, a public DIRLAB 4D-CT dataset, and a 4D cone-beam CT (4D-CBCT) dataset. Compared with the iteration-based demon method and two deep learning-based methods (VoxelMorph and recursive cascaded network), the RCFRR-Net achieved consistent and significant gains, which demonstrated that the proposed method had superior performance and generalization capability in medical image registration.

A major barrier to this therapeutic goal is their instability during aerosolization for local delivery. This imparts a shear force that degrades the mRNA cargo and therefore reduces cell transfection. In addition to remaining stable upon aerosolization, mRNA LNPs must also possess the aerodynamic properties to achieve deposition in clinically relevant areas of the lungs. We addressed these challenges by formulating mRNA LNPs with SM-102, the clinically approved ionizable lipid in the Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine. Our lead candidate, B-1, had the highest mRNA expression in both a physiologically relevant air?liquid interface (ALI) human lung cell model and in healthy mice lungs upon aerosolization. Further, B-1 showed selective transfection in vivo of lung epithelial cells compared to immune cells and endothelial cells. These results show that the formulation can target therapeutically relevant cells in pulmonary diseases such as cystic fibrosis. Morphological studies of B-1 revealed differences in the surface structure compared to LNPs with lower transfection efficiency. Importantly, the formulation maintained critical aerodynamic properties in simulated human airways upon next generation impaction. Finally, structure?function analysis of SM-102 revealed that small changes in the number of carbons can improve upon mRNA delivery in ALI human lung cells. Overall, our study expands the application of SM-102 and its analogs to aerosolized pulmonary delivery and identifies a potent lead candidate for future therapeutically active mRNA therapies.","2023-11","2024-05-27 00:55:42","2024-05-30 00:08:47","2024-05-27 00:55:37","e10580","","6","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/DK6VR34F/Lewis et al. - 2023 - Optimization of ionizable lipids for aerosolizable.pdf","","No problem","mRNA; ionizable lipid; lipid nanoparticle; aerosolization; pulmonary delivery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In immunodeficient post-hematopoietic stem cell transplanted mice, immunization with CpG-OVA-HAC2 elicited a strong antibody response, three orders of magnitude higher than dose-matched bolus injection.

It contributes to the pathogenesis of ischemic brain injury. However, the effects of RIPostC on pyroptosis following AIS remain largely unknown. In our study, linear correlation analysis confirmed that serum GSDMD levels in AIS patients upon admission were positively correlated with NIHSS scores.

Besides, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery was performed on C57BL/6 male mice and RIPostC was induced immediately after MCAO.

The implantable system is composed of pump cavity, valves and tubes, which are soft and flexible made by silica gel. Therefore, the system possesses similar modulus to tissues and can naturally fit surrounding tissues. The cavity with magnetic tablet embedded is driven by extracorporeal magnetic field. Subsequently, the system can drain ascites with a top speed of 23?mL?min?1, much higher than that of natural lymphatic system and state-of-art devices.

However, given the delicate genetic nature of how these genes are integrated and expressed, current methods of producing gas vesicle-expressing mammalian cell lines requires significant cell processing time to establish a clonal/polyclonal line that robustly expresses the gas vesicles sufficiently enough for ultrasound contrast. Here, we describe an inducible and drug-selectable acoustic reporter gene system that can enable gas vesicle expression in mammalian cell lines, which we demonstrate using HEK293T cells. Our drug-selectable construct design increases the stability and proportion of cells that successfully integrate all plasmids into their genome, thus reducing the amount of cell processing time required. Additionally, we demonstrate that our drug-selectable strategy forgoes the need for single-cell cloning and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and that a drug-selected mixed population is sufficient to generate robust ultrasound contrast. Successful gas vesicle expression was optically and ultrasonically verified, with cells expressing gas vesicles exhibiting an 80% greater signal-to-noise ratio compared to negative controls and a 500% greater signal-to-noise ratio compared to wild-type HEK293T cells. This technology presents a new reporter gene paradigm by which ultrasound can be harnessed to visualize specific cell types for applications including cellular reporting and cell therapies.","2024-03","2024-05-27 00:56:27","2024-05-30 00:02:08","2024-05-27 00:56:14","e10584","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/FUUNBK4V/Howells et al. - 2024 - A drug-selectable acoustic reporter gene system fo.pdf","","No bar","cell engineering; acoustic reporter genes; ultrasound imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although various formulations have been developed for reliable sealing of soft tissue, tradeoffs between adhesive properties, degradation profile, and tissue toxicity limit their clinical use. Hydrogel-based adhesives, for example, are highly biocompatible but adhere very weakly to the tissue and degrade quickly, while oxidized cellulose patches are poorly absorbed and may cause healing complications postoperatively. Here, we present a novel strategy for tissue sealing based on bioadhesive microneedle patches that can spontaneously adhere to tissue surface through electrostatic interactions and swell within it. A series of microneedle patches made of pullulan, chitosan, Carbopol, poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid), and a Carbopol/chitosan combination were fabricated and characterized for their use in tissue sealing. The effect of microneedle composition on the fabrication process, physical and mechanical properties, in vitro cytotoxicity, and in vivo biocompatibility were examined. The needle structure enables microneedles to strongly fix onto various tissues via physical interlocking, while their adhesive properties improve staying time and sealing capabilities. The microneedle patch comprising Carbopol needles and chitosan as a second pedestal layer presented the best results in terms of sealing and adhesion, a consequence of the needle's swelling and adhesion features combined with the supportive chitosan base layer. Finally, single Carbopol/chitosan patches stopped intense liver bleeding in a rat model significantly quicker and with less blood loss compared with commercial oxidized cellulose patches. These microneedles can be considered a promising cost-effective platform for adhering and sealing tissues as they can be applied quickly and painlessly, and require less trained medical staff and equipment.","2023-08","2024-05-27 00:56:27","2024-05-29 23:59:09","2024-05-27 00:56:15","e10578","","n/a","n/a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/55SW8KL7/Freundlich et al. - 2023 - Bioadhesive microneedle patches for tissue sealing.pdf; /Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/XNAYYWGS/btm2.html","","No problem","biomaterials; bioadhesive; Carbopol; chitosan; microneedle; sealant; tissue regeneration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But the physiology and function of formed vessels in the vMPS is currently assessed by non-standardized, user-dependent, and simple morphological metrics that poorly relate to the fundamental function of oxygenation of organs. Here, a chained neural network is engineered and trained using morphological metrics derived from a diverse set of vMPS representing random combinations of factors that influence the vascular network architecture of a tissue. This machine-learned algorithm outputs a singular measure, termed as vascular network quality index (VNQI). Cross-correlation of morphological metrics and VNQI against measured oxygen levels within vMPS revealed that VNQI correlated the most with oxygen measurements. VNQI is sensitive to the determinants of vascular networks and it consistently correlates better to the measured oxygen than morphological metrics alone. Finally, the VNQI is positively associated with the functional outcomes of cell transplantation therapies, shown in the vascularized islet-chip challenged with hypoxia. Therefore, adoption of this tool will amplify the predictions and enable standardization of organ-chips, transplant models, and other cell biosystems.","2023-11","2024-05-27 00:56:27","2024-05-30 01:00:15","2024-05-27 00:56:15","e10582","","6","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ET92SKKX/Tronolone et al. - 2023 - Machine learning chained neural network analysis o.pdf","","No problem","machine learning; artificial intelligence; cell transplant; islet; microphysiological system; vascularization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Disease progression has been determined as a multifactor phenomenon and can be treated based on the host immune response within each individual. CoST is an electrochemical immunosensor point-of-care device that can determine disease severity through multiplex measurement and quantification of spike protein, nucleocapsid protein, D-dimer, and IL-2R from 100??L of plasma samples within a few minutes. The limit of detection was found to be 3?ng/mL and 21?ng/mL for S and N proteins whereas for D-dimer and IL-2R it was 0.0006?ng/mL and 0.242?ng/mL, respectively. Cross-reactivity of all the biomarkers was studied and it was found to be <20%. Inter and intra-assay variability of the CoST sensor was less than <15% confirming its ability to detect the target biomarker in body fluids. In addition, this platform has also been tested to quantify all four biomarkers in 40 patient samples and to predict the severity index. A significant difference was observed between healthy and COVID-19 samples with a p-value of 0.0002 for D-dimer and?<0.0001 for other proteins confirming the ability of the COST sensor to be used as a point of care device to assess disease severity at clinical sites. This device platform can be modified to impact a wide range of disease indications where prognostic monitoring of the host response can be critical in modulating therapy.","2023-09","2024-05-27 00:56:27","2024-05-30 00:11:37","2024-05-27 00:56:19","e10566","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/PLCAB7JN/Madhurantakam et al. - 2023 - COVID severity test (CoST sensor)—An electrochemic.pdf","","No problem","COVID-19; biosensors; medical devices; nanobiology; patient-targeted therapies; rapid diagnostics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The development of effective and non-invasive strategies to prevent DOX-associated adverse cardiac events is urgently needed. We aimed to examine whether and how low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) plays a protective role in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Male C57BL/6J mice were used to establish models of both acute and chronic DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. Non-invasive LIPUS therapy was conducted for four consecutive days after DOX administration. Cardiac contractile function was evaluated by echocardiography. Myocardial apoptosis, oxidative stress, and fibrosis were analyzed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining, dihydroethidium (DHE) staining, and picrosirius red staining assays. RNA-seq analysis was performed to unbiasedly explore the possible downstream regulatory mechanisms. Neutrophil recruitment and infiltration in the heart were analyzed by flow cytometry. The S100a8/a9 inhibitor ABR-238901 was utilized to identify the effect of S100a8/a9 signaling. We found that LIPUS therapy elicited a great benefit on DOX-induced heart contractile dysfunction in both acute and chronic DOX models. Chronic DOX administration increased serum creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, as well as myocardial apoptosis, all of which were significantly mitigated by LIPUS. In addition, LIPUS treatment prevented chronic DOX-induced cardiac oxidative stress and fibrosis. RNA-seq analysis revealed that LIPUS treatment partially reversed alterations of gene expression induced by DOX. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the downregulated genes between DOX-LIPUS and DOX-Sham groups indicated that inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis might be involved in the protective effects of LIPUS therapy. Flow cytometry analysis illustrated the inhibitory effects of LIPUS on DOX-induced neutrophil recruitment and infiltration in the heart. Moreover, S100 calcium binding protein A8/A9 (S100a8/a9) was identified as a potential key target of LIPUS therapy. S100a8/a9 inhibition by ABR-238901 showed a similar heart protective effect against DOX-induced cardiomyopathy to LIPUS treatment.

The grafted epidermis was analogue to native human skin from day 30th onward, revealing well-structured strata with well-differentiated keratinocytes expressing CK5, CK8, CK10, claudin, plakoglobin, filaggrin, and involucrin in a similar way to controls, suggesting that the epidermis was able to mature and differentiate very early. Melanocytes and Langerhans cells were found from day 30th onward, together with a basement membrane, abundant hemidesmosomes and lack of rete ridges. At the dermal layer, we found an interface between the grafted skin and the host tissue at day 30th, which tended to disappear with time. The grafted superficial dermis showed a progressive increase in properly-oriented collagen fibers, elastic fibers and proteoglycans, including decorin, similarly to control dermis at day 60-90th of in vivo follow-up. Blood vessels determined by CD31 and SMA expression were more abundant in grafted skin than controls, whereas lymphatic vessels were more abundant at day 90th.

In this study, dual gene-activated dermal scaffolds (DGADSs-1) were fabricated by loading nanocomposite particles of polyethylenimine (PEI)/multiple plasmid DNAs (pDNAs) encoding vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-1 at a ratio of 1:1. In a similar manner, DGADSs-2 were loaded with a chimeric plasmid encoding both VEGF and Ang-1. In vitro studies showed that both types of DGADSs released PEI/pDNA nanoparticles in a sustained manner; they demonstrated effective transfection ability, leading to upregulated expression of VEGF and Ang-1. Furthermore, both types of DGADSs promoted fibroblast proliferation and blood vessel formation, although DGADSs-1 showed a more obvious promotion effect. A rat full-thickness skin defect model showed that split-thickness skin transplanted using a one-step method could achieve full survival at the 12th day after surgery in both DGADSs-1 and DGADSs-2 groups, and the vascularization time of dermal substitutes was significantly shortened. Compared with the other three groups of scaffolds, the DGADSs-1 group had significantly greater cell infiltration, collagen deposition, neovascularization, and vascular maturation, all of which promoted wound healing. Thus, compared with single-gene-activated dermal scaffolds, DGADSs show greater potential for enhancing angiogenesis. DGADSs with different loading modes also exhibited differences in terms of angiogenesis; the effect of loading two genes (DGADSs-1) was better than the effect of loading a chimeric gene (DGADSs-2).

We applied biomechanical force to Mks using two methods: shake flask cultures and a syringe pump system. Force increased MkEV production in a magnitude-dependent manner, with similar trends emerging regardless of whether flow cytometry or nanoparticle tracking analysis was used for MkEV counting. Both methods produced MkEVs that were relatively depleted of miR-486-5p and miR-22-3p cargo. However, while the shake flask-derived MkEVs were correspondingly less effective in promoting megakaryocytic differentiation of HSPCs, the syringe pump-derived MkEVs were more effective in doing so, suggesting the presence of unique, unidentified miRNA cargo components. Higher numbers of MkEVs were also produced by ?older? Mk cultures, though miRNA cargo levels and MkEV bioactivity were unaffected by culture age. A reduction in MkEV production by Mks derived from late-differentiating HSPCs was also noted. Taken together, our results demonstrate that biomechanical force has an underappreciated and deeply influential role in MkEV biology, though that role may vary significantly depending on the nature of the force. Given the ubiquity of biomechanical force in vivo and in biomanufacturing, this phenomenon must be grappled with before MkEVs can attain clinical relevance.","2023-09","2024-05-27 00:56:27","2024-05-30 00:22:21","2024-05-27 00:56:27","e10563","","5","8","","","Similar but distinct","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/WSGGNS3E/Thompson and Papoutsakis - 2023 - Similar but distinct The impact of biomechanical .pdf","","No problem","extracellular vesicles; biomanufacturing; biomechanical force; hematopoietic stem cells; megakaryocytes; platelets","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, reactivation of latent proviruses within infected cells is heterogeneous and often incomplete. This fact limits strategies to cure HIV which may require complete elimination of viable virus from all cellular reservoirs. For this reason, understanding the mechanism(s) of reactivation of HIV within cellular reservoirs is critical to achieve therapeutic success. Methodologies enabling temporal tracking of single cells as they reactivate followed by sorting and molecular analysis of those cells are urgently needed. To this end, microraft arrays were adapted to image T-lymphocytes expressing mCherry under the control of the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter, in response to the application of LRAs (prostratin, iBET151, and SAHA). In response to prostratin, iBET151, and SAHA, 30.5%, 11.2%, and 12.1% percentage of cells, respectively. The arrays enabled large numbers of single cells (>25,000) to be imaged over time. mCherry fluorescence quantification identified cell subpopulations with differing reactivation kinetics. Significant heterogeneity was observed at the single-cell level between different LRAs in terms of time to reactivation, rate of mCherry fluorescence increase upon reactivation, and peak fluorescence attained. In response to prostratin, subpopulations of T lymphocytes with slow and fast reactivation kinetics were identified. Single T-lymphocytes that were either fast or slow reactivators were sorted, and single-cell RNA-sequencing was performed. Different genes associated with inflammation, immune activation, and cellular and viral transcription factors were found.","2023-09","2024-05-27 00:57:10","2024-05-29 23:56:30","2024-05-27 00:56:59","e10551","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/9CEIZXDA/Cortés-Llanos et al. - 2023 - Automated microarray platform for single-cell sort.pdf","","No problem","microarrays; HIV latency reactivation; single-cell; time-lapse imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, bio-stimulation mechanisms of light therapy in terms of ROS-heat shock proteins (HSPs) mediated anti-apoptotic and angiogenic pathways in human adult stem cells have not been fully delineated yet. Commonly used light sources such as light-emitting diode (LED) and laser are accompanied by drawbacks, such as phototoxicity, thermal damage, and excessive ROS induction, so the role and clinical implications of light-induced HSPs need to be investigated using a heat-independent light source. Here, we introduced organic LED (OLED) at 610?nm wavelength as a new light source to prevent thermal effects from interfering with the expression of HSPs. Our results showed that light therapy using OLED significantly upregulated anti-apoptotic and angiogenic factors in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) at both gene and protein levels via the activation of HSP90α and HSP27, which were stimulated by ROS. In a mouse wound-closing model, rapid recovery and improved re-epithelization were observed in the light-treated hMSCs transplant group. This study demonstrates that the upregulation of Akt (protein kinase B)-nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-?B) signaling, caused by HSP90α and HSP27 expression, is the mechanism behind the anti-apoptotic and angiogenic effects of OLED treatment on stem cells.","2023-09","2024-05-27 00:57:10","2024-05-30 00:16:54","2024-05-27 00:57:02","e10560","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/BV7S9SHK/Seo et al. - 2023 - Enhancing viability and angiogenic efficacy of mes.pdf; /Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/JMDD28YZ/btm2.html","","No bar","wound healing; angiogenesis; anti-apoptosis; heat shock proteins; human mesenchymal stem cells; organic light-emitting diode (OLED)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Functional DNA was bound to the surface of biotin-PEG2000-modified graphitic carbon nitride (Bio-PEG-CN) nanosheets to form non-cationic nanocomplexes Bio-PEG-CN/DNA. These nanocomposites could actively target HCC tissue. Once these nanocomplexes were taken up by tumor cells, the accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by Bio-PEG-CN under LED irradiation would disrupt the lysosome structure, thereby facilitating nanocomposites escape. Due to the acidic microenvironment and lipase in the HCC tissue, the reversible release of DNA could be promoted to complete the transfection process. Meanwhile, the fluorescence signal of Bio-PEG-CN could be monitored in real time by fluorescence imaging technology to investigate the transfection process and mechanism. In vitro and in vivo results further demonstrated that these nanocomplexes could remarkably upregulate the expression of tumor suppressor protein P53, increased tumor sensitivity to ROS generated by nanocarriers, and realized effective gene therapy for HCC via loading P53 gene.","2023-09","2024-05-27 00:57:10","2024-05-30 00:10:36","2024-05-27 00:57:02","e10558","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/3XLEEVYV/Liu et al. - 2023 - Light controlled self-escape capability of non-cat.pdf; /Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/EGI2LSKK/btm2.html","","No problem","gene therapy; gene delivery; CN-based nanosheets; light controlled; non-cationic carrier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is of great significance to rebuild the BSCB at the early stage of SCI to alleviate the secondary injury for better prognosis. Yet, current research involved in the reconstruction of BSCB is insufficient. Accordingly, we provide a thermosensitive hydrogel-based G protein-coupled receptor 124 (GPR124) delivery strategy for rebuilding BSCB. Herein, we firstly found that the expression of GPR124 decreased post-SCI and demonstrated that treatment with recombinant GPR124 could partially alleviate the disruption of BSCB post-SCI by restoring tight junctions (TJs) and promoting migration and tube formation of endothelial cells. Interestingly, GPR124 could also boost the energy metabolism of endothelial cells. However, the absence of physicochemical stability restricted the wide usage of GPR124. Hence, we fabricated a thermosensitive heparin-poloxamer (HP) hydrogel that demonstrated sustained GPR124 production and maintained the bioactivity of GPR124 (HP@124) for rebuilding the BSCB and eventually enhancing functional motor recovery post-SCI. HP@124 hydrogel can encapsulate GPR124 at the lesion site by injection, providing prolonged release, preserving wounded tissues, and filling injured tissue cavities. Consequently, it induces synergistically efficient integrated regulation by blocking BSCB rupture, decreasing fibrotic scar formation, minimizing inflammatory response, boosting remyelination, and regenerating axons. Mechanistically, giving GPR124 activates energy metabolism via elevating the expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (PCK2), and eventually restores the poor state of endothelial cells. This research demonstrated that early intervention by combining GPR124 with bioactive multifunctional hydrogel may have tremendous promise for restoring locomotor recovery in patients with central nervous system disorders, in addition to a translational approach for the medical therapy of SCI.","2023-09","2024-05-27 00:57:10","2024-05-30 00:18:04","2024-05-27 00:57:04","e10561","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/Z64BA2JH/Shu et al. - 2023 - Thermosensitive hydrogel-based GPR124 delivery str.pdf; /Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/KT9X7L8R/btm2.html","","No problem","controlled release; blood-spinal cord barrier; energy metabolism; GPR124; spinal cord injury; thermosensitive hydrogel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we describe an innovative macrophage-based approach to deliver anti-fibrotic protein to the lung and inhibit PF in a mouse model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung injury. We engineered macrophages to continuously secrete three types of proteins: interleukin-10, which prevents inflammation; TGFRcFc, a soluble truncated TGF-?R2 that blocks TGF-?; and CD147, which induces matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and causes collagen degradation. Infusing these engineered macrophages into the lungs of BLM-induced PF mouse models in an optimal pattern significantly ameliorated PF in mice. Specifically, the most effective therapeutic outcome was achieved by infusing IL-10-secreting macrophages on day 1, followed by TGFRcFc-secreting macrophages on day 7 and CD147-secreting macrophages on day 14 into the same mice after BLM treatment. Our data suggest that macrophage-based delivery of anti-fibrotic proteins to the lungs is a promising therapy for fibrotic lung disorders.","2023-09","2024-05-27 00:57:10","2024-05-30 00:10:22","2024-05-27 00:57:04","e10555","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/98HCMXYK/Liu et al. - 2023 - Macrophage-based delivery of anti-fibrotic protein.pdf","","No problem","IL-10; bleomycin; CD147; engineered macrophages; idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; TGF-β","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several limitations, including immune isolation, prevent this therapy from reaching its full potential. Cell encapsulation devices used for BCRT provide a protective physical barrier for insulin-producing beta cells, thereby protecting transplanted cells from immune attack. However, poor device engraftment posttransplantation leads to nutrient deprivation and hypoxia, causing metabolic strain on transplanted beta cells. Prevascularization of encapsulation devices at the transplantation site can help establish a host vascular network around the implant, increasing solute transport to the encapsulated cells. Here, we present a replenishable prevascularized implantation methodology (RPVIM) that allows for the vascular integration of replenishable encapsulation devices in the subcutaneous space. Empty encapsulation devices were vascularized for 14?days, after which insulin-producing cells were inserted without disrupting the surrounding vasculature. The RPVIM devices were compared with nonprevascularized devices (Standard Implantation Methodology [SIM]) and previously established prevascularized devices (Standard Prevascularization Implantation Methodology [SPVIM]). Results show that over 75% of RPVIM devices containing stem cell-derived insulin-producing beta cell clusters showed a signal after 28?days of implantation in subcutaneous space. Notably, not only was the percent of RPVIM devices showing signal significantly greater than SIM and SPVIM devices, but the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests and histological analyses showed that encapsulated stem-cell derived insulin-producing beta cell clusters retained their function in the RPVIM devices, which is crucial for the successful management of T1D.","2023-07","2024-05-27 00:57:10","2024-05-29 23:55:42","2024-05-27 00:57:07","e10520","","4","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/D8VU7CN3/Chendke et al. - 2023 - Replenishable prevascularized cell encapsulation d.pdf","","No problem","beta cell replacement therapy; cell encapsulation device; human stem cells; prevascularization; transplantation in subcutaneous space; type 1 diabetes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent advances in microfluidics have enabled permeabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane by physical cell deformation (i.e., mechanoporation), resulting in intracellular delivery of impermeable macromolecules in vector- and electrophoretic-free approaches. However, the number of payloads (e.g., peptides) and/or concentrations delivered via microfluidic mechanoporation is limited by having to pre-mix cells and payloads, a manually intensive process. In this work, we show that cells are momentarily permeable (t1/2?=?1.1?2.8?min) after microfluidic vortex shedding (?VS) and that lower molecular weight macromolecules can be cytosolically delivered upon immediate exposure after cells are processed/permeabilized. To increase the ability to screen peptides, we built a system, dispensing-microfluidic vortex shedding (D?VS), that integrates a ?VS chip with inline microplate-based dispensing. To do so, we synced an electronic pressure regulator, flow sensor, on/off dispense valve, and an x-y motion platform in a software-driven feedback loop. Using this system, we were able to deliver low microliter-scale volumes of transiently mechanoporated cells to hundreds of wells on microtiter plates in just several minutes (e.g., 96-well plate filled in <2.5?min). We validated the delivery of an impermeable peptide directed at MDM2, a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor p53, using a click chemistry- and NanoBRET-based cell permeability assay in 96-well format, with robust delivery across the full plate. Furthermore, we demonstrated that D?VS could be used to identify functional, low micromolar, cellular activity of otherwise cell-inactive MDM2-binding peptides using a p53 reporter cell assay in 96- and 384-well format. Overall, D?VS can be combined with downstream cell assays to investigate intracellular target engagement in a high-throughput manner, both for improving structure?activity relationship efforts and for early proof-of-biology of non-optimized peptide (or potentially other macromolecular) tools.","2023-09","2024-05-27 00:57:10","2024-05-30 00:04:20","2024-05-27 00:57:08","e10542","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/5YU3KE8J/Kasper et al. - 2023 - A high-throughput microfluidic mechanoporation pla.pdf","","No problem","microfluidics; intracellular delivery; automation; cell-based assays; cyclic peptides; protein–protein interactions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dual-targeted inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) have emerged as promising cancer therapy candidates. However, poor aqueous solubility and bioavailability limited their efficacy in cancer. The present study investigates the encapsulation of a PI3-Kδ/HDAC6 dual inhibitor into hybrid block copolymers (polylactic acid-methoxy polyethylene glycol; polylactic acid-polyethylene glycol-polypropylene glycol-polyethylene glycol-polylactic acid) (HSB-510) as a delivery system to target PI3-Kδ and HDAC6 pathways in breast cancer cells. The prepared HSB-510 showed an average diameter of 96?±?3?nm, a zeta potential of ?17?±?2?mV, and PDI of ?0.1 with a slow and sustained release profile of PI3-Kδ/HDAC6 inhibitors in a nonphysiological buffer. In vitro studies with HSB-510 have demonstrated substantial growth inhibition of breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-468, SUM-149, MCF-7, and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) as well as downregulation of phospho-AKT, phospho-ERK, and c-Myc levels. Importantly, bi-weekly treatment of Balb/c wild-type mice harboring EAC cells with HSB-510 at a dose of 25?mg/kg resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition. The treatment with HSB-510 was without any significant effect on the body weights of the mice.

With this approach, the canonical cancer cells SK-BR-3, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231, maintain their characteristic expression of markers (i.e., ERα, HER2, and PGR) while developing distinct morphology. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrate how culture in the FN-silk networks modulates the biological processes of cell adhesion and migration while affecting physiological events involved in malignancy, such as inflammation, remodeling of the ECM, and resistance to anticancer drugs.

Umbilical cord mesenchymal-derived stem cells (UC-MSCs) have been applied to clinical trials to promote lung repair through stem cell niche restruction. However, the application of UC-MSCs is hampered by the effectiveness of cell transplantation with few cells homing to the injury sites and poor retention, survival, and proliferation in vivo. In this study, we constructed an artificial three-dimensional (3D) biomimetic scaffold-based MSCs implant to establish a beneficial regeneration niche for endogenous stem cells in situ lung regeneration. The therapeutic potential of 3D biomimetic scaffold-based MSCs implants was evaluated by 3D culture in vitro. And RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was mapped to explore the gene expression involved in the niche improvement. Next, a model of partial lung resection was established in rats, and the implants were implanted into the operative region. Effects of the implants on rat resected lung injury repair were detected. The results revealed that UC-MSCs loaded on biomimetic scaffolds exerted strong paracrine effects and some UC-MSCs migrated to the lung from scaffolds and had long-term retention to suppress inflammation and fibrosis in residual lungs and promoted vascular endothelial cells and alveolar type II epithelial cells to enter the scaffolds.

Herein, a natural-derived antibacterial drug, tannic acid (TA), was incorporated into the electrospun polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber (TA/PVA fiber, 952?±?40?nm in diameter). TA worked as a cross-linker via hydrogen bonding with PVA to improve the physicochemical properties of the fiber and to reach a sustained drug release (88% release of drug at 48?h). Improved mechanical property (0.8?1.2?MPa) and computational simulation validated the formation of the hydrogen bonds between TA and PVA. Moreover, the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory characteristics of TA laid the foundation for the application of TA/PVA fiber in repairing infected wounds. Meanwhile, in vitro studies proved the high hemocompatibility and cytocompatibility of TA/PVA fiber. Further in vivo animal investigation showed that the TA/PVA fiber promoted the repair of infected wound by inhibiting the bacterial growth, promoting granulation formation, and collagen matrix deposition, accelerating angiogenesis, and inducing M2 macrophage polarization within 14?days. All the data demonstrated that the TA cross-linked fiber would be a potent dressing for bacteria-infected wound healing.","2023-11","2024-05-27 00:57:45","2024-05-30 00:11:20","2024-05-27 00:57:35","e10540","","6","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/QBHHPXKX/Luo et al. - 2023 - Drug cross-linking electrospun fiber for effective.pdf","","No problem","tannic acid; electrospinning; infected wound; molecular simulation; polyvinyl alcohol","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study proposes a method for diagnosing atherosclerosis in the carotid artery using nanometer biomarker measurements through surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) from single-drop blood samples. Atherosclerotic acceleration is induced in apolipoprotein E knockout mice which underwent a partial carotid ligation and were fed a high-fat diet to rapidly induce disturbed flow-induced atherosclerosis in the left common carotid artery while using the unligated, contralateral right carotid artery as control. The progressive atherosclerosis development of the left carotid artery was verified by micro-magnetic resonance imaging (micro-MRI) and histology in comparison to the right carotid artery. Single-drop blood samples are deposited on chips of gold-coated ZnO nanorods grown on silicon wafers that filter the nanometer markers and provide strong SERS signals. A diagnostic classifier was established based on principal component analysis (PCA), which separates the resultant spectra into the atherosclerotic and control groups. Scoring based on the principal components enabled the classification of samples into control, mild, and severe atherosclerotic disease. The PCA-based analysis was validated against an independent test sample and compared against the PCA-PLS-DA machine learning algorithm which is known for applicability to Raman diagnosis. The accuracy of the PCA modification-based diagnostic criteria was 94.5%, and that of the machine learning algorithm 97.5%. Using a mouse model, this study demonstrates that diagnosing and classifying the severity of atherosclerosis is possible using a single blood drop, SERS technology, and machine learning algorithm, indicating the detectability of biomarkers and vascular factors in the blood which correlate with the early stages of atherosclerosis development.","2023-07","2024-05-27 00:57:45","2024-05-30 00:08:35","2024-05-27 00:57:37","e10529","","4","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/KGDBT8BA/Lee et al. - 2023 - Label-free atherosclerosis diagnosis through a blo.pdf","","No problem","atherosclerosis; ApoE KO mouse; nano-sized biomarker; principal component analysis; surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the greatest challenge in tracheal-replacement therapy is the promotion of tissue regeneration by rapid graft vascularization. Traditional prevascularization methods for tracheal grafts typically utilize omentum or muscle flap wrapping, which requires a second operation; vascularized segment tracheal orthotopic transplantation in one step remains difficult. This study proposes a method to construct a tissue-engineered tracheal graft, which directly forms the microvascular network after orthotopic transplantation in vivo. The focus of this study was the preparation of a hybrid tracheal graft that is non-immunogenic, has good biomechanical properties, supports cell proliferation, and quickly vascularizes. The results showed that vacuum-assisted decellularized trachea-polycaprolactone hybrid scaffold could match most of the above requirements as closely as possible. Furthermore, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were extracted and used as vascularized seed cells and seeded on the surfaces of hybrid grafts before and during the tracheal orthotopic transplantation. The results showed that the microvascularized tracheal grafts formed maintained the survival of the recipient, showing a satisfactory therapeutic outcome. This is the first study to utilize EPCs for microvascular construction of long-segment trachea in one-step; the approach represents a promising method for microvascular tracheal reconstruction.","2023-07","2024-05-27 00:57:45","2024-05-30 00:18:39","2024-05-27 00:57:38","e10534","","4","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/95DGDBZ2/Sun et al. - 2023 - Biomimetic in situ tracheal microvascularization f.pdf","","No problem","tissue engineering; endothelial progenitor cells; functionalization; microvascularization; tracheal transplantation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 3D printed master mold and negative mold can be reused, thereby significantly reducing the cost. HMNs are based on biocompatible materials, such as heat-curing polymers or light-curing resins. The thickness and rigidity/flexibility characteristics of the substrate can be customized for different applications. The drug delivery efficiency of the fabricated HMNs was verified by the in situ treatment of psoriasis on the backs of mice, which required only a 0.1-fold oral dose to achieve similar efficacy, and the associated side effects and drug toxicity were reduced.

As a result, no standard of care exists for long-segment tracheal reconstruction. Tissue engineering has the potential to create a scaffold from allografts or xenografts that can support neotissue regeneration identical to the native trachea. Recent advances in tissue engineering have led to the idea of partial decellularization that allows for the creation of tracheal scaffolds that supports tracheal epithelial formation while preserving mechanical properties. However, the ability of partial decellularization to eliminate graft immunogenicity remains unknown, and understanding the immunogenic properties of partially decellularized tracheal grafts (PDTG) is a critical step toward clinical translation. Here, we determined that tracheal allograft immunogenicity results in epithelial cell sloughing and replacement with dysplastic columnar epithelium and that partial decellularization creates grafts that are able to support an epithelium without histologic signs of rejection. Moreover, allograft implantation elicits CD8+ T-cell infiltration, a mediator of rejection, while PDTG did not. Hence, we establish that partial decellularization eliminates allograft immunogenicity while creating a scaffold for implantation that can support spatially appropriate airway regeneration.","2023-09","2024-05-27 00:57:45","2024-05-30 00:19:18","2024-05-27 00:57:40","e10525","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/RYV6ARNI/Tan et al. - 2023 - Partial decellularization eliminates immunogenicit.pdf","","No problem","regenerative medicine; decellularization; immunogenicity; orthotopic tracheal transplantation; tissue-engineered tracheal graft","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis mouse model, we then assessed the therapeutic effect of the LGG-encapsulating hydrogel. This achieved intestinal delivery of LGG with minimal loss of enzymatic function and viability, ameliorating colitis by reducing epithelial damage, submucosal edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and the number of goblet cells.

Beyond the limitations of conventional treatments including endoscopic balloon dilatation and the application of oral/topical corticosteroids, several cell therapies have been recently attempted. However, such methods are still limited in clinical situations and existing setups, and the efficacies are less in some cases since the transplanted cells hardly remain at the resection site for a long time due to swallowing and peristalsis of the esophagus. Thus, a cell transplantation platform directly applicable with clinically established equipment and enabling stable retention of transplanted cells can be a promising therapeutic option for better clinical outcomes. Inspired by ascidians that rapidly self-regenerate, this study demonstrates endoscopically injectable and self-crosslinkable hyaluronate that allows both endoscopic injection in a liquid state and self-crosslinking as an in situ-forming scaffold for stem cell therapy. The pre-gel solution may compatibly be applied with endoscopic tubes and needles of small diameters, based on the improved injectability compared to the previously reported endoscopically injectable hydrogel system. The hydrogel can be formed via self-crosslinking under in vivo oxidative environment, while also exhibiting superior biocompatibility.

This study addresses the tolerability, acceptability, and reproducibility of STAR particles rubbed on the skin at multiple pressures and after multiple applications to human subjects. One-time STAR particle application at pressures between 40 and 80?kPa showed that skin microporation and erythema directly correlated with increased pressure, and 83% of subjects reported STAR particles to be comfortable at all pressures. Repeated application of STAR particles for 10 consecutive days at 80?kPa showed that skin microporation (~0.5% of skin area), erythema (low-to-moderate), and comfort with self-administration (75%) were similar over the course of the study. Comfort of sensations associated with STAR particles increased from 58% to 71% during the study, and familiarity with STAR particles increased from 12.5% to 50% of subjects reporting STAR particle application not feeling different from other skin products. This study demonstrates that topically applied STAR particles were well tolerated and highly acceptable after application at various pressures and repeated daily use.

However, there is difficulty in obtaining and maintaining a system that allows researchers to study physiologically relevant cardiac development, maturation, and drug screening due to the issues around inconsistent contractions of cardiomyocytes. Butterfly wings have special nanostructures arranged in parallel, which could help generate the alignment of cardiomyocytes to better mimic the natural heart tissue structure. Here, we construct a conduction-consistent human cardiac muscle patch by assembling human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) on graphene oxide (GO) modified butterfly wings. We also show this system functions as a versatile model to study human cardiomyogenesis by assembling human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac progenitor cells (hiPSC-CPCs) on the GO modified butterfly wings. The GO modified butterfly wing platform facilitated the parallel orientation of hiPSC-CMs, enhanced relative maturation as well as improved conduction consistency of the cardiomyocytes. In addition, GO modified butterfly wings enhanced the proliferation and maturation characteristics of the hiPSC-CPCs. In accordance with data obtained from RNA-sequencing and gene signatures, assembling hiPSC-CPCs on GO modified butterfly wings stimulated the differentiation of the progenitors into relatively mature hiPSC-CMs. These characteristics and capabilities of GO modified butterfly wings make them an ideal platform for heart research and drug screening.","2023-05","2024-05-27 00:57:45","2024-05-30 00:19:05","2024-05-27 00:57:44","e10522","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/DDEP5D4T/Tan et al. - 2023 - Engineering a conduction-consistent cardiac patch .pdf","","No problem","induced pluripotent stem cells; cardiomyocyte maturation; conduction consistent; morpho butterflies; oxidized graphene","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To overcome this, we have developed a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) immunosensor for rapid PoC detection of JEV nonstructural 1 (NS1) antigen (Ag), found circulating in serum of infected individuals using a smartphone based portable ?Sensit? device. The modification of SPCE surface with JEV NS1 antibody (Ab) was confirmed via observation of globular protein structures via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), increase in electrode surface hydrophilicity via contact angle measurement and decrease in current via differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The fabrication and testing parameters were optimized based on highest current output obtained using DPV. The SPCE was tested for detection limit of target JEV NS1 Ag ranging from 1 fM to 1 ?M, which was determined as 0.45?fM in spiked serum. The disposable immunosensor was also found to be highly specific in detecting JEV NS1 Ag over other flaviviral NS1 Ag. Finally, the modified SPCE was clinically validated by testing 62 clinical JEV samples using both a portable miniaturized electrochemical ?Sensit? device coupled with a smartphone and a laboratory-based potentiostat. The results were corroborated with gold-standard RT-PCR and showed 96.77% accuracy, 96.15% sensitivity, and 97.22% specificity.

Synthetic hemostats that are stable at room temperature, easy to carry, field-usable, and able to stop internal bleeding at multiple or unknown sources, are still lacking. We recently developed a hemostatic agent via polymer peptide interfusion (HAPPI), which can selectively bind to activated platelets and injury sites after intravascular administration. Here we report that HAPPI is highly effective in treating multiple lethal traumatic bleeding conditions in normal as well as hemophilia models via either systemic administration or topical application. In a rat liver traumatic model, intravenous injection of HAPPI resulted in a significant decrease in blood loss and a four-fold reduction in mortality rate within 2?h after injury. When applied topically on liver punch biopsy wounds in heparinized rats, HAPPI achieved a 73% of reduction in blood loss and a five-fold increase in survival rate. HAPPI also exhibited hemostatic efficacy in hemophilia A mice by reducing blood loss. Further, HAPPI worked synergistically with rFVIIa to induce immediate hemostasis and 95% reduction in total blood loss compared to the saline-treated group in hemophelia mice models. These results demonstrate that HAPPI is a promising field-usable hemostatic agent for a broad range of different hemorrhagic conditions.","2023-05","2024-05-27 00:57:45","2024-05-29 23:59:30","2024-05-27 00:57:45","e10516","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/CBPDTDLV/Gao et al. - 2023 - A polymer-based systemic hemostat for managing unc.pdf","","No problem","hemophilia; hemostasis; hyaluronic acid; systemic hemostat; traumatic bleeding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using this Real-Time Fluorometric Flowing Fibrinolysis assay (RT-FluFF assay), a tPa-dependent degree of thrombolysis was observed both via clot mass loss as well as fluorometrically monitored release of FITC-labeled fibrin degradation products.

The platform is easily adapted to produce pulsatile flows. Hemodynamics of human main pulmonary artery were mimicked through matching dimensionless flow parameters calculated using clinical data. Increasing pressure amplitude range (4?40?mmHg) results in a 20% increase of fibrinolysis at 1000?ng/mL tPA. Increasing shear flow rate (205?913?s?1) significantly increases fibrinolysis and mechanical digestion.

Adult male C57BL/6 or Balbc mice and HL-1 myocardial cell line were performed for in vivo and in vitro experiments, respectively. NR1H3 knockout mice or NR1H3 agonist T0901317 was applied to evaluate the impact of NR1H3 on septic heart failure. We found decreased myocardial expression levels of NR1H3-related molecules while increased NLRP3 level in septic mice. NR1H3 knockout worsensed cardiac dysfunction and injury in mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), in association with exacerbated NLRP3-mediated inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis-related markers. The administration of T0901317 reduced systemic infection and improve cardiac dysfunction in septic mice. Moreover, Co-IP assays, luciferase reporter assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, confirmed that NR1H3 directly repressed NLRP3 activity. Finally, RNA-seq detection further clarified an overview of the roles of NR1H3 in sepsis.

In this study, a gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)-based hydrogel was designed for in vitro and in vivo PDAC experiments. The GelMA-based hydrogel has porous, adjustable mechanical properties and excellent in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility. The GelMA-based in vitro 3D culture method can effectively form a gradient and stable extracellular matrix stiffness, affecting cell morphology, cytoskeleton remodeling, and malignant biological behaviors such as proliferation and metastasis. This model is suitable for in vivo studies with long-term maintenance of matrix stiffness and no significant toxicity. High matrix stiffness can significantly promote PDAC progression and tumor immunosuppression.

To determine the amount of drug delivered through skin, in vitro drug permeation testing is commonly used, but the testing is costly and time-consuming. To address this issue, machine learning methods were employed to predict drug permeation through the skin, circumventing the need of conducting skin permeation experiments. By comparing the experimental data and simulated results, it was found extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) was the best among the four simulation methods.

The DxCell-Complex quantitatively detected the target-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) within 1 h. Validation with clinical human serum containing SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies confirmed 97.04% sensitivity and 93.33% specificity. The platform can be redirected against other antibodies.

To solve these problems, we developed the PA-N-2-HACC-Cys NPs loaded with anti-inflammatory hydrophobic drug curcumin (CUR) (CUR@PA-N-2-HACC-Cys NPs) by self-assembled amphiphilic polymer, composed of the N-2-Hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride chitosan (N-2-HACC), hydrophobic palmitic acid (PA), and cysteine (Cys). After oral administration, the CUR@PA-N-2-HACC-Cys NPs had good stability and sustained release under gastrointestinal conditions, followed by adhering to the intestine to achieve drug mucosal delivery. Additionally, the NPs could penetrate mucus and epithelial barriers to promote cellular uptake. The CUR@PA-N-2-HACC-Cys NPs could open tight junctions between cells for transepithelial transport while striking a balance between mucus interaction and diffusion through mucus. Notably, the CUR@PA-N-2-HACC-Cys NPs improved the oral bioavailability of CUR, which remarkably relieved colitis symptoms and promoted mucosal epithelial repair.

A single DDS administration allowed a significant bacterial burden reduction in a short period of time, without exacerbating host inflammatory response.

Knowledge of mechanobiology in 2D culture has allowed researchers in bone tissue engineering to develop 3D dynamic culture systems with the potential for clinical translation in which the fate and growth of BMSC are mechanically controlled. However, due to the complexity of 3D dynamic cell culture compared to the 2D counterpart, the mechanisms of cell regulation in the dynamic environment remain relatively undescribed. In the present study, we analyzed the cytoskeletal modulation and osteogenic profiles of BMSC under fluid stimuli in a 3D culture condition using a perfusion bioreactor. BMSC subjected to fluid shear stress (mean 1.56?mPa) showed increased actomyosin contractility, accompanied by the upregulation of mechanoreceptors, focal adhesions, and Rho GTPase-mediated signaling molecules. Osteogenic gene expression profiling revealed that fluid shear stress promoted the expression of osteogenic markers differently from chemically induced osteogenesis. Osteogenic marker mRNA expression, type 1 collagen formation, ALP activity, and mineralization were promoted in the dynamic condition, even in the absence of chemical supplementation. The inhibition of cell contractility under flow by Rhosin chloride, Y27632, MLCK inhibitor peptide-18, or Blebbistatin revealed that actomyosin contractility was required for maintaining the proliferative status and mechanically induced osteogenic differentiation in the dynamic culture. The study highlights the cytoskeletal response and unique osteogenic profile of BMSC in this type of dynamic cell culture, stepping toward the clinical translation of mechanically stimulated BMCS for bone regeneration.","2023-05","2024-05-27 00:58:41","2024-05-30 01:05:46","2024-05-27 00:58:36","e10509","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ZMICZH6C/Yamada et al. - 2023 - Unique osteogenic profile of bone marrow stem cell.pdf","","No problem","bioreactor; actomyosin contraction; bone tissue engineering; fluid shear stress; osteogenic differentiation; Rho GTPase signaling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the characteristics of tissue remodeling and regeneration, M2c macrophages have attracted great attention in research on immune modulation that rebuilds degenerated tissues. Therefore, we first demonstrated the facilitating effects of M2c macrophages on ECM anabolism of the NP in vitro. We subsequently found that exosomes from M2c macrophages (M2c-Exoss) mediated their metabolic rebalancing effects on the ECM. To determine whether M2c-Exoss served as positive agents protecting the ECM in IVDD, we constructed an M2c-Exos-loaded hyaluronic acid hydrogel (M2c-Exos@HA hydrogel) and implanted it into the degenerated caudal disc of rats. The results of MRI and histological staining indicated that the M2c-Exos@HA hydrogel alleviated IVDD in vivo in the long term. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism, we performed 4D label-free proteomics to screen dysregulated proteins in NPs treated with M2c-Exoss. Cartilage intermediate layer protein (CILP) was the key protein responsible for the rebalancing effects of M2c-Exoss on ECM metabolism in the NP. With prediction and verification using luciferase assays and rescue experiments, miR-124-3p was identified as the upstream regulator in M2c-Exoss that regulated CILP and consequently enhanced the activity of the TGF-?/smad3 pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrated ameliorating effects of M2c-Exoss on the imbalance of ECM metabolism in IVDD via the miR-124/CILP/TGF-? regulatory axis, which provides a promising theoretical basis for the application of M2c macrophages and their exosomes in the treatment of IVDD.","2023-11","2024-05-27 00:58:41","2024-05-30 00:11:07","2024-05-27 00:58:41","e10500","","6","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/TM5PBSV7/Liu et al. - 2023 - Exosomes from M2c macrophages alleviate interverte.pdf","","No problem","macrophages; miRNAs; cartilage intermediate layer protein; exosomes; intervertebral disc degeneration; M2c polarization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Targeting therapeutics specifically to hepatocytes is often a challenge since they are relatively nonendocytosing unlike the highly phagocytic Kupffer cells in the liver. Approaches that enable targeted intracellular delivery of therapeutics to hepatocytes have significant promise in addressing liver disorders. We synthesized a galactose-conjugated hydroxyl polyamidoamine dendrimer (D4-Gal) that targets hepatocytes efficiently through the asialoglycoprotein receptors in healthy mice and in a mouse model of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver failure. D4-Gal localized specifically in hepatocytes and showed significantly better targeting when compared with the non-Gal functionalized hydroxyl dendrimer. The therapeutic potential of D4-Gal conjugated to N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) was tested in a mouse model of APAP-induced liver failure. A single intravenous dose of a conjugate of D4-Gal and NAC (Gal-D-NAC) improved survival in APAP mice, decreased cellular oxidative injury and areas of necrosis in the liver, even when administered at the delayed time point of 8?h after APAP exposure. Overdose of APAP is the most common cause of acute hepatic injury and liver transplant need in the United States, and is treated with large doses of NAC administered rapidly within 8?h of overdose leading to systemic side effects and poor tolerance. NAC is not effective when treatment is delayed. Our results suggest that D4-Gal is effective in targeting and delivering therapies to hepatocytes and Gal-D-NAC has the potential to salvage and treat liver injury with a broader therapeutic window.","2023-05","2024-05-27 00:59:15","2024-05-30 00:14:33","2024-05-27 00:59:02","e10486","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/EMFRF9ZP/Porterfield et al. - 2023 - Galactosylated hydroxyl-polyamidoamine dendrimer t.pdf","","No problem","drug delivery; acetaminophen poisoning; dendrimers; hepatocytes targeting; liver injury; N-acetyl cysteine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We recently showed that use of specific IRL wavelengths, which inhibit the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (COX), leads to robust neuroprotection in animal models of focal and global brain ischemia/reperfusion injury. These life-threatening conditions can be caused by an ischemic stroke or cardiac arrest, respectively, two leading causes of death. To translate IRL therapy into the clinic an effective technology must be developed that allows efficient delivery of IRL to the brain while addressing potential safety concerns. Here, we introduce IRL delivery waveguides (IDWs) which meet these demands. We employ a low-durometer silicone that comfortably conforms to the shape of the head, avoiding pressure points. Furthermore, instead of using focal IRL delivery points via fiberoptic cables, lasers, or light-emitting diodes, the distribution of the IRL across the entire area of the IDW allows uniform IRL delivery through the skin and into the brain, preventing ?hot spots? and thus skin burns. The IRL delivery waveguides have unique design features, including optimized IRL extraction step numbers and angles and a protective housing. The design can be scaled to fit various treatment areas, providing a novel IRL delivery interface platform. Using fresh (unfixed) human cadavers and isolated cadaver tissues, we tested transmission of IRL via IDWs in comparison to laser beam application with fiberoptic cables. Using the same IRL output energies IDWs performed superior in comparison to the fiberoptic delivery, leading to an up to 95% and 81% increased IRL transmission for 750 and 940?nm IRL, respectively, analyzed at a depth of 4 cm into the human head. We discuss the unique safety features and potential further improvements of the IDWs for future clinical implementation.","2023-05","2024-05-27 00:59:15","2024-05-30 00:12:44","2024-05-27 00:59:02","e10496","","3","8","","","Non-invasive treatment of ischemia/reperfusion injury","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/85KUJTCT/Morse et al. - 2023 - Non-invasive treatment of ischemiareperfusion inj.pdf","","No problem","cadaver; infrared light; ischemia/reperfusion; light penetration; mitochondria; stroke; waveguide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite recent efforts towards miniaturization and surface chemistry modification, clinically available GDIs are susceptible to high rates of fibrosis and surgical failure. Here, we describe the development of synthetic, nanofiber-based GDIs with partially degradable inner cores. We evaluated GDIs with nanofiber or smooth surfaces to investigate the effect of surface topography on implant performance. We observed in vitro that nanofiber surfaces supported fibroblast integration and quiescence, even in the presence of pro-fibrotic signals, compared to smooth surfaces. In rabbit eyes, GDIs with a nanofiber architecture were biocompatible, prevented hypotony, and provided a volumetric aqueous outflow comparable to commercially available GDIs, though with significantly reduced fibrotic encapsulation and expression of key fibrotic markers in the surrounding tissue.

Here, a cell recognitive osteogenic barrier coating was proposed using a bioengineered mussel adhesive protein (MAP) fused with Alg?Gly?Asp (RGD) peptide to achieve highly accelerated bone regeneration. The fusion bioadhesive MAP-RGD exhibited outstanding performance as a bioactive physical barrier that enabled effective cell occlusion and a prolonged, localized delivery of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). The MAP-RGD@BMP-2 coating promoted in vitro cellular behaviors and osteogenic commitments of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) via the synergistic crosstalk effects of the RGD peptide and BMP-2 in a surface-bound manner. The facile gluing of MAP-RGD@BMP-2 onto the Ti-mesh led to a distinguishable acceleration of the in vivo formation of new bone in terms of quantity and maturity in a rat calvarial defect.

However, its clinical applications are limited by hemolysis, nonspecific cytotoxicity, and rapid metabolism. Herein, a novel genetically engineered vesicular antibody-melittin (VAM) drug delivery platform was proposed and validated for targeted cancer combination therapy. VAM generated from the cellular plasma membrane was bio-synthetically fabricated, with the recombinant protein (hGC33 scFv-melittin) being harbored and displayed on the cell membrane. The bioactive and targetable nanomelittin conjugated by hGC33 scFv could be released in an MMP14-responsive manner at tumor sites, which reduced off-target toxicity, especially the hemolytic activity of melittin. Importantly, VAM could be loaded with small-molecule drugs or nanoparticles for combination therapy. Nanomelittin formed pores in membranes and disturbed phospholipid bilayers, which allowed the anticancer agents (i.e., chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin and sonosensitizer purpurin 18 nanoparticles) co-delivered by VAM to penetrate deeper tumor sites, leading to synergistic therapeutic effects. In particular, the punching effect generated by sonodynamic therapy further improved the immunomodulatory effect of nanomelittin to activate the immune response.

As a translational research, we investigated the effect of various process parameters on the fabrication of exenatide-loaded PLGA microspheres by SFEE (ELPM_SFEE) using the Box?Behnken design (BBD), a design of experiment approach. Further, ELPM obtained under optimized conditions and satisfying all the response criteria were compared with PLGA microspheres prepared using the conventional solvent evaporation (ELPM_SE) method through various solid-state characterizations and in vitro and in vivo evaluations. The four process parameters selected as independent variables were pressure (X1), temperature (X2), stirring rate (X3), and flow ratio (X4). The effects of these independent variables on five responses, namely the particle size, its distribution (SPAN value), encapsulation efficiency (EE), initial drug burst release (IBR), and residual organic solvent, were evaluated using BBD. Based on the experimental results, a desirable range of combinations of various variables in the SFEE process was determined by graphical optimization. Solid-state characterization and in vitro evaluation revealed that ELPM_SFEE improved properties, including a smaller particle size and SPAN value, higher EE, lower IBR, and lower residual solvent. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study results indicated better in vivo efficacy with desirable SR properties, including a reduction in blood glucose levels, weight gain, and food intake, for ELPM_SFEE than those generated using SE. Therefore, the potential drawback of conventional technologies such as the SE for the preparation of injectable SR PLGA microspheres could be improved by optimizing the SFEE process.","2023-05","2024-05-27 00:59:15","2024-05-30 00:13:28","2024-05-27 00:59:15","e10485","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/TW6I36MM/Park et al. - 2023 - Injectable sustained-release poly(lactic-co-glycol.pdf","","No bar","Box–Behnken design; exenatide; pharmacodynamic; pharmacokinetic; PLGA microspheres; supercritical fluid extraction of emulsions; sustained-release","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
