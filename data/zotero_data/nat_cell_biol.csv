To fill this gap, we developed an approach to perform metabolomics on primary prostate epithelial cells. Using this approach, we discovered that the basal and luminal cells of the prostate exhibit distinct metabolomes and nutrient utilization patterns. Furthermore, basal-to-luminal differentiation is accompanied by increased pyruvate oxidation. We establish the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier and subsequent lactate accumulation as regulators of prostate luminal identity.

Therefore, understanding the regulation of myeloid cell differentiation during cancer is crucial to counteract their pro-tumourigenic role. Bone marrow (BM) haematopoiesis is a tightly regulated process for the production of all immune cells in accordance to tissue needs14. Myeloid cells differentiate during haematopoiesis from multipotent haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)15–17. HSPCs can sense inflammatory signals from the periphery during infections18–21 or inflammatory disorders22–27. In these settings, HSPC expansion is associated with increased myeloid differentiation28,29. During carcinogenesis, the elevation of haematopoietic growth factors supports the expansion and differentiation of committed myeloid progenitors5,30. However, it is unclear whether cancer-related inflammation also triggers demand-adapted haematopoiesis at the level of multipotent HSPCs. In the BM, HSPCs reside within the haematopoietic niche which delivers HSC maintenance and differentiation cues31–35. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a major cellular component of the BM niche and contribute to HSC homeostasis36–41. Modifications of MSCs in systemic disorders have been associated with HSC differentiation towards myeloid cells22,42. It is unknown if MSCs are regulated in the context of solid tumours and if their myeloid supportive activity is impacted by cancer-induced systemic changes. Here, using unbiased transcriptomic analysis and in situ imaging of HSCs and the BM niche during breast cancer, we show that both HSCs and MSCs are transcriptionally and spatially modified. We demonstrate that breast tumour can distantly remodel the cellular cross-talks in the BM niche leading to increased myelopoiesis.","2023-12","2024-05-27 22:34:52","2024-05-28 04:30:51","2024-05-27 22:34:52","1736-1745","","12","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/Z6782BZ7/Gerber-Ferder et al. - 2023 - Breast cancer remotely imposes a myeloid bias on h.pdf","","No problem","Breast cancer; Haematopoietic stem cells; Myelopoiesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In nerveless bone marrow, steady-state haematopoiesis was normal but haematopoietic and vascular regeneration were impaired after myeloablation. LepR+ cells, and the adipocytes they gave rise to, increased NGF production after myeloablation, promoting nerve sprouting in the bone marrow and haematopoietic and vascular regeneration. Nerves promoted regeneration by activating β2 and β3 adrenergic receptor signalling in LepR+ cells, and potentially in adipocytes, increasing their production of multiple haematopoietic and vascular regeneration growth factors.

Here we show a role for host-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in this process; human and murine plasma-derived and cell culture-derived EVs have an intrinsic capacity to bind bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Remarkably, circulating host EVs capture blood-borne LPS in vivo, and the LPS-laden EVs confer cytosolic access for LPS, triggering non-canonical inflammasome activation of gasdermin D and pyroptosis. Mechanistically, the interaction between the lipid bilayer of EVs and the lipid A of LPS underlies EV capture of LPS, and the intracellular transfer of LPS by EVs is mediated by CD14. Overall, this study demonstrates that EVs capture and escort systemic LPS to the cytosol licensing inflammasome responses, uncovering EVs as a previously unrecognized link between systemic microbial ligands and intracellular surveillance.","2023-12","2024-05-27 22:34:52","2024-05-28 04:28:44","2024-05-27 22:34:52","1860-1872","","12","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/76VLCJ3D/Kumari et al. - 2023 - Host extracellular vesicles confer cytosolic acces.pdf","","No problem","Innate immune cells; Cell death; Inflammasome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior work has shown that brain cancers and metastases are densely infiltrated with anti-inflammatory, protumourigenic tumour-associated macrophages, but the role of brain-resident microglia remains controversial because they are challenging to discriminate from other tumour-associated macrophages. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, genetic and humanized mouse models, we specifically identify microglia and find that they play a distinct pro-inflammatory and tumour-suppressive role in BCBM. Animals lacking microglia show increased metastasis, decreased survival and reduced natural killer and T cell responses, showing that microglia are critical to promote anti-tumour immunity to suppress BCBM. We find that the pro-inflammatory response is conserved in human microglia, and markers of their response are associated with better prognosis in patients with BCBM.

ADP-ribosyltransferases (PARPs) and sirtuins rely on NAD+ to mediate post-translational modifications of target proteins. The activation of PARP1 in response to DNA breaks leads to rapid depletion of cellular NAD+ compromising cell viability. Therefore, the levels of NAD+ must be tightly regulated. Here we show that exogenous NAD+, but not its precursors, has a direct effect on mitochondrial activity. Short-term incubation with NAD+ boosts Kreb’s cycle and the electron transport chain and enhances pyrimidine biosynthesis. Extended incubation with NAD+ results in depletion of pyrimidines, accumulation of purines, activation of the replication stress response and cell cycle arrest. Moreover, a combination of NAD+ and 5-fluorouridine selectively kills cancer cells that rely on de novo pyrimidine synthesis.

Although a few studies have shed light on the process of discarding damaged mitochondria, how mitochondria are exported and the functions of mitochondrial release remain largely unclear. Here we describe mitopherogenesis, a formerly unknown process that specifically secretes mitochondria through a unique extracellular vesicle termed a ‘mitopher’. We observed that during sperm development in male Caenorhabditis elegans, healthy mitochondria are exported out of the spermatids through mitopherogenesis and each of the generated mitophers harbours only one mitochondrion. In mitopherogenesis, the plasma membrane first forms mitochondrion-embedding outward buds, which then promptly bud off and thereby result in the generation of mitophers. Mechanistically, extracellular protease signalling in the testis triggers mitopher formation from spermatids, which is partially mediated by the tyrosine kinase SPE-8. Moreover, mitopherogenesis requires normal microfilament dynamics, whereas myosin VI antagonizes mitopher generation. Strikingly, our three-dimensional electron microscopy analyses indicate that mitochondrial quantity requires precise modulation during sperm development, which is critically mediated by mitopherogenesis. Inhibition of mitopherogenesis causes accumulation of mitochondria in sperm, which may lead to sperm motility and fertility defects. Our findings identify mitopherogenesis as a previously undescribed process for mitochondria-specific ectocytosis, which may represent a fundamental branch of mechanisms underlying mitochondrial quantity control to regulate cell functions during development.","2023-11","2024-05-27 22:34:52","2024-05-28 04:37:48","2024-05-27 22:34:52","1625-1636","","11","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/I8NBYUBR/Liu et al. - 2023 - Mitopherogenesis, a form of mitochondria-specific .pdf","","Zero","Spermatogenesis; Mitochondria","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We identify metastasis-promoting genes that are de novo licensed following oestrogen exposure in a MAF-dependent manner. The histone demethylase KDM1A is key to the epigenomic remodelling that facilitates the expression of the pro-metastatic MAF/oestrogen-driven gene expression program, and loss of KDM1A activity prevents this metastasis.

O-GlcNAcylation attenuates the translation-promoting function of YTHDF1 and YTHDF3 by blocking their interactions with proteins associated with mRNA translation.

Here we show that MLL1/KMT2A methylates Borealin K143 in the intrinsically disordered region essential for liquid–liquid phase separation of the chromosome passenger complex (CPC). The co-crystal structure highlights the distinct binding mode of the MLL1 SET domain with Borealin K143. Inhibiting MLL1 activity or mutating Borealin K143 to arginine perturbs CPC phase separation, reduces Aurora kinase B activity, and impairs the resolution of erroneous kinetochore–microtubule attachments and sister-chromatid cohesion. They significantly increase chromosome instability and aneuploidy in a subset of hepatocellular carcinoma, resulting in growth inhibition.

We identified NEAT1 deletion mutants that assemble paraspeckles that are incorporated into nuclear speckles. Several paraspeckle proteins, including SFPQ, HNRNPF and BRG1, prevent this incorporation and thus contribute to the segregation of paraspeckles from nuclear speckles. Shell localization of these proteins in the paraspeckles, which is determined by NEAT1_2 long noncoding RNA domains, is required for this segregation process. Conversely, U2-related spliceosomal proteins are involved in internalizing the paraspeckles into nuclear speckles.

Shortly after fertilization, upregulation of Xist RNA from one X chromosome initiates XCI, leading to chromosome-wide gene silencing. XCI is maintained in all cell types, except the germ line and the pluripotent state where XCI is reversed. The mechanisms triggering Xist upregulation have remained elusive. Here we identify GATA transcription factors as potent activators of Xist. Through a pooled CRISPR activation screen in murine embryonic stem cells, we demonstrate that GATA1, as well as other GATA transcription factors can drive ectopic Xist expression. Moreover, we describe GATA-responsive regulatory elements in the Xist locus bound by different GATA factors. Finally, we show that GATA factors are essential for XCI induction in mouse preimplantation embryos. Deletion of GATA1/4/6 or GATA-responsive Xist enhancers in mouse zygotes effectively prevents Xist upregulation.

We hypothesized competition with mouse satellite cells (SCs) prevented SMPC engraftment into the SC niche and thus generated an SC ablation mouse compatible with human engraftment. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of SC-ablated mice identified the absence of a transient myofibre subtype during regeneration expressing Actc1. Similarly, ACTC1+ human myofibres supporting PAX7+ SMPCs increased in SC-ablated mice, and after re-injury we found SMPCs could now repopulate into chimeric niches. To demonstrate ACTC1+ myofibres are essential to supporting PAX7 SMPCs, we generated caspase-inducible ACTC1 depletion human pluripotent stem cells, and upon SMPC engraftment we found a 90% reduction in ACTC1+ myofibres and a 100-fold decrease in PAX7 cell numbers compared with non-induced controls.

Preferential association between caveolae and straight segments of the fibrils, and between invadosomes and bent segments of the fibrils, was observed along with matrix remodelling. Caveola recruitment precedes and is required for invadosome formation and activity. Reciprocally, invadosome disruption results in the accumulation of fibril-associated caveolae. Moreover, caveolae and the collagen receptor β1 integrin co-localize at contact sites with the fibrils, and integrins control caveola recruitment to fibrils. In turn, caveolae mediate the clearance of β1 integrin and collagen uptake in an invadosome-dependent and collagen-cleavage-dependent mechanism.

Bulk lipids, carried by specialized lipoproteins, are secreted into the circulation, initially via the coat protein complex II (COPII). How the universal COPII machinery accommodates the abundant yet unconventional lipoproteins remains unclear, let alone its therapeutic translation. Here we report that COPII uses manganese-tuning, self-constrained condensation to selectively drive lipoprotein delivery and set lipid homeostasis in vivo. Serendipitously, adenovirus hijacks the condensation-based transport mechanism, thus enabling the identification of cytosolic manganese as an unexpected control signal. Manganese directly binds the inner COPII coat and enhances its condensation, thereby shifting the assembly-versus-dynamics balance of the transport machinery. Manganese can be mobilized from mitochondria stores to signal COPII, and selectively controls lipoprotein secretion with a distinctive, bell-shaped function. Consequently, dietary titration of manganese enables tailored lipid management that counters pathological dyslipidaemia and atherosclerosis, implicating a condensation-targeting strategy with broad therapeutic potential for cardio-metabolic health.","2023-11","2024-05-27 22:34:52","2024-05-28 04:33:42","2024-05-27 22:34:52","1650-1663","","11","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/VWX9JBL8/Wang et al. - 2023 - Manganese regulation of COPII condensation control.pdf","","No problem","Membrane trafficking; Metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Legionella pneumophila, an intracellular bacterial pathogen and the causative organism of Legionnaires’ disease, secretes a subset of protein effectors into host cells that inhibit translation elongation. Mechanistic insights into how the bacterium targets translation elongation remain poorly defined. We report here that the Legionella effector SidI functions in an unprecedented way as a transfer-RNA mimic that directly binds to and glycosylates the ribosome. The 3.1 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of SidI reveals an N-terminal domain with an ‘inverted L’ shape and surface-charge distribution characteristic of tRNA mimicry, and a C-terminal domain that adopts a glycosyl transferase fold that licenses SidI to utilize GDP–mannose as a sugar precursor. This coupling of tRNA mimicry and enzymatic action endows SidI with the ability to block protein synthesis with a potency comparable to ricin, one of the most powerful toxins known. In Legionella-infected cells, the translational pausing activated by SidI elicits a stress response signature mimicking the ribotoxic stress response, which is activated by elongation inhibitors that induce ribosome collisions. SidI-mediated effects on the ribosome activate the stress kinases ZAKα and p38, which in turn drive an accumulation of the protein activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). Intriguingly, ATF3 escapes the translation block imposed by SidI, translocates to the nucleus and orchestrates the transcription of stress-inducible genes that promote cell death, revealing a major role for ATF3 in the response to collided ribosome stress. Together, our findings elucidate a novel mechanism by which a pathogenic bacterium employs tRNA mimicry to hijack a ribosome-to-nuclear signalling pathway that regulates cell fate.","2023-11","2024-05-27 22:34:52","2024-05-28 04:35:27","2024-05-27 22:34:52","1600-1615","","11","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/Y665J26J/Subramanian et al. - 2023 - A Legionella toxin exhibits tRNA mimicry and glyco.pdf","","No problem","Microbiology; Cryoelectron microscopy; Stress signalling; Translation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This switch is triggered by the interaction between the SH3 domain of UNC-89 (titin/obscurin) and MEC-2.

Here we show that, during heat shock in yeast and human cells, oRPs accumulate as reversible peri-nucleolar condensates recognized by the Hsp70 co-chaperone Sis1/DnaJB6. oRP condensates are liquid-like in cell-free lysate but solidify upon depletion of Sis1 or inhibition of Hsp70. When cells recover from heat shock, oRP condensates disperse in a Sis1- and Hsp70-dependent manner, and the oRP constituents are incorporated into functional ribosomes in the cytosol, enabling cells to efficiently resume growth.

This crosstalk between SCLC cells and astrocytes drives the induction of gene expression programmes that are similar to those found during early brain development in neurons and astrocytes. Mechanistically, the brain development factor Reelin, secreted by SCLC cells, recruits astrocytes to brain metastases. These astrocytes in turn promote SCLC growth by secreting neuronal pro-survival factors such as SERPINE1. Thus, SCLC brain metastases grow by co-opting mechanisms involved in reciprocal neuron–astrocyte interactions during brain development.

A grommet-like function is required to restrict the NE hole in anaphase B, whereas replacement of Cmp7 by a sealing module ultimately closes the NE in interphase.

These dual-origin enzymes pose a complex gene regulatory challenge for cells requiring coordinated gene expression across organelles. To identify genes involved in dual-origin protein complex synthesis, we performed fluorescence-activated cell-sorting-based genome-wide screens analysing mutant cells with unbalanced levels of mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded subunits of Complex IV. We identified genes involved in OXPHOS biogenesis, including two uncharacterized genes: PREPL and NME6. We found that PREPL specifically impacts Complex IV biogenesis by acting at the intersection of mitochondrial lipid metabolism and protein synthesis, whereas NME6, an uncharacterized nucleoside diphosphate kinase, controls OXPHOS biogenesis through multiple mechanisms reliant on its NDPK domain. Firstly, NME6 forms a complex with RCC1L, which together perform nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity to maintain local mitochondrial pyrimidine triphosphate levels essential for mitochondrial RNA abundance. Secondly, NME6 modulates the activity of mitoribosome regulatory complexes, altering mitoribosome assembly and mitochondrial RNA pseudouridylation. Taken together, we propose that NME6 acts as a link between compartmentalized mitochondrial metabolites and mitochondrial gene expression.","2023-11","2024-05-27 22:34:52","2024-05-28 04:38:36","2024-05-27 22:34:52","1575-1589","","11","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/U2RGNT4F/Kramer et al. - 2023 - Regulators of mitonuclear balance link mitochondri.pdf","","No problem","RNA metabolism; Mitochondria; Gene regulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, we identify the iron-binding histone-demethylase KDM3B as an intrinsic iron sensor that regulates mTORC1 activity by demethylating H3K9me2 at enhancers of a high-affinity leucine transporter, LAT3, and RPTOR. By directly suppressing leucine availability and RAPTOR levels, iron deficiency supersedes other nutrient inputs into mTORC1. This process occurs in vivo and is not an indirect effect by canonical iron-utilizing pathways.

Mettl3 enforces transcriptional dormancy through two interconnected mechanisms: (1) it promotes global mRNA destabilization and (2) it suppresses global nascent transcription by destabilizing the mRNA of the transcriptional amplifier and oncogene N-Myc, which we identify as a crucial anti-pausing factor. Knockdown of N-Myc rescues pausing in Mettl3−/− ES cells, and forced demethylation and stabilization of Mycn mRNA in paused wild-type ES cells largely recapitulates the transcriptional defects of Mettl3−/− ES cells.

RBFOX2 can recruit RBM15, an MTC component, to facilitate methylation of promoter-associated RNAs. RBM15 also physically interacts with YTHDC1 and recruits polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to the RBFOX2-bound loci for chromatin silencing and transcription suppression. Furthermore, we found that this RBFOX2/m6A/RBM15/YTHDC1/PRC2 axis plays a critical role in myeloid leukaemia. Downregulation of RBFOX2 notably inhibits survival/proliferation of acute myeloid leukaemia cells and promotes their myeloid differentiation.

These membranes exhibit a micron-scale segregation of lipids into ordered and disordered phases, excluding NPCs from the ordered phase. Balanced lipid saturation is required for NPC integrity, pore membrane curvature and nucleocytoplasmic transport.

This ensures that cells are metabolically active only when conditions are optimal for growth. Notably, although mTORC1 is known to regulate fatty acid biosynthesis, how and whether the cellular lipid biosynthetic capacity signals back to fine-tune mTORC1 activity remains poorly understood. Here we show that mTORC1 senses the capacity of a cell to synthesise fatty acids by detecting the levels of malonyl-CoA, an intermediate of this biosynthetic pathway. We find that, in both yeast and mammalian cells, this regulation is direct, with malonyl-CoA binding to the mTOR catalytic pocket and acting as a specific ATP-competitive inhibitor. When fatty acid synthase (FASN) is downregulated/inhibited, elevated malonyl-CoA levels are channelled to proximal mTOR molecules that form direct protein–protein interactions with acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and FASN. Our findings represent a conserved and unique homeostatic mechanism whereby impaired fatty acid biogenesis leads to reduced mTORC1 activity to coordinately link this metabolic pathway to the overall cellular biosynthetic output.

We find that FCR rapidly goes through an interesting route for pluripotent reprogramming, uniquely transitioning through a developmentally diapause-like state. Furthermore, FCR critically enables comprehensive characterizations using multi-omics technologies, and has revealed unexpected important features including key regulatory factors and epigenetic dynamics. Particularly, activation of pluripotency-related endogenous retroviruses via inhibition of heterochromatin significantly enhances reprogramming.

Here we show that feeding Caenorhabditis elegans with ursolic acid, a natural plant product, improves axon transport and reduces adult-onset axon fragility intergenerationally. Ursolic acid provides neuroprotection by enhancing maternal provisioning of sphingosine-1-phosphate, a bioactive sphingolipid. Intestine-to-oocyte sphingosine-1-phosphate transfer is required for intergenerational neuroprotection and is dependent on the RME-2 lipoprotein yolk receptor. Sphingosine-1-phosphate acts intergenerationally by upregulating the transcription of the acid ceramidase-1 (asah-1) gene in the intestine. Spatial regulation of sphingolipid metabolism is critical, as inappropriate asah-1 expression in neurons causes developmental axon outgrowth defects.

Here we tackle this question with SOX9, a master regulator that diverts embryonic epidermal stem cells (EpdSCs) into becoming hair follicle stem cells. By engineering mice to re-activate SOX9 in adult EpdSCs, we trigger fate switching. Combining epigenetic, proteomic and functional analyses, we interrogate the ensuing chromatin and transcriptional dynamics, slowed temporally by the mature EpdSC niche microenvironment. We show that as SOX9 binds and opens key hair follicle enhancers de novo in EpdSCs, it simultaneously recruits co-factors away from epidermal enhancers, which are silenced.

SMS2 assembles into immobile foci that adhere on the basal membrane at the leading edge. When cells migrate away, the SMS2 foci ‘move’ out of cells and into retraction fibres, where they become migrasome formation sites and eventually grow into migrasomes. Mechanistically, SMS2 foci seed migrasomes by converting ceramide to sphingomyelin, which is essential for migrasome formation. Furthermore, CerS5, which is required for the synthesis of long-chain ceramide, and CERT, which transports ceramide from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi, are both required for migrasome formation.

At a cellular level, H3K36M facilitates epithelial plasticity by rendering fibroblasts insensitive to TGFβ signals. At a molecular level, H3K36M enables the decommissioning of mesenchymal enhancers and the parallel activation of epithelial/stem cell enhancers.

Here we discovered that loss of microRNA (miR)-128 in zebrafish leads to an expansion of HSPCs in the AGM with different cell cycle states and a skew towards erythroid and lymphoid progenitors. Manipulating miR-128 in differentiating haemogenic endothelial cells, before their transition to HSPCs, recapitulated the lineage skewing in both zebrafish and human pluripotent stem cells. miR-128 promotes Wnt and Notch signalling in the AGM via post-transcriptional repression of the Wnt inhibitor csnk1a1 and the Notch ligand jag1b. De-repression of cskn1a1 resulted in replicative and erythroid-biased HSPCs, whereas de-repression of jag1b resulted in G2/M and lymphoid-biased HSPCs with long-term consequence on the respective blood lineages.

Several clinical reports have linked COVID-19 during pregnancy to negative birth outcomes and placentitis. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning SARS-CoV-2 infection during placentation and early pregnancy are not clear. Here, to shed light on this, we used induced trophoblast stem cells to generate an in vitro early placenta infection model. We identified that syncytiotrophoblasts could be infected through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Using a co-culture model of vertical transmission, we confirmed the ability of the virus to infect syncytiotrophoblasts through a previous endometrial cell infection.

STING, a putative innate immune signalling adaptor, has a pivotal role in mounting antitumour immunity by coordinating innate sensing and adaptive immune surveillance in myeloid cells. STING is markedly silenced in various human malignancies and acts as a cell-intrinsic tumour suppressor. How STING exerts intrinsic antitumour activity remains unclear. Here, we report that STING restricts aerobic glycolysis independent of its innate immune function. Mechanistically, STING targets hexokinase II (HK2) to block its hexokinase activity. As such, STING inhibits HK2 to restrict tumour aerobic glycolysis and promote antitumour immunity in vivo. In human colorectal carcinoma samples, lactate, which can be used as a surrogate for aerobic glycolysis, is negatively correlated with STING expression level and antitumour immunity. Taken together, this study reveals that STING functions as a cell-intrinsic metabolic checkpoint that restricts aerobic glycolysis to promote antitumour immunity. These findings have important implications for the development of STING-based therapeutic modalities to improve antitumour immunotherapy.","2023-08","2024-05-27 22:35:49","2024-05-28 04:54:14","2024-05-27 22:35:49","1208-1222","","8","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ELDU6QN7/Zhang et al. - 2023 - STING is a cell-intrinsic metabolic checkpoint res.pdf","","No problem","Tumour immunology; Innate immunity; Cancer metabolism; Colorectal cancer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Surprisingly, we find that class 3 phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), known best for its essential role as a lipid kinase in endocytosis and lysosomal degradation by autophagy, has an overlooked nuclear function in gene transcription as a coactivator of the heterodimeric transcription factor and circadian driver Bmal1–Clock. Canonical pro-catabolic functions of class 3 PI3K in trafficking rely on the indispensable complex between the lipid kinase Vps34 and regulatory subunit Vps15. We demonstrate that although both subunits of class 3 PI3K interact with RNA polymerase II and co-localize with active transcription sites, exclusive loss of Vps15 in cells blunts the transcriptional activity of Bmal1–Clock. Thus, we establish non-redundancy between nuclear Vps34 and Vps15, reflected by the persistent nuclear pool of Vps15 in Vps34-depleted cells and the ability of Vps15 to coactivate Bmal1–Clock independently of its complex with Vps34. In physiology we find that Vps15 is required for metabolic rhythmicity in liver and, unexpectedly, it promotes pro-anabolic de novo purine nucleotide synthesis. We show that Vps15 activates the transcription of Ppat, a key enzyme for the production of inosine monophosphate, a central metabolic intermediate for purine synthesis. Finally, we demonstrate that in fasting, which represses clock transcriptional activity, Vps15 levels are decreased on the promoters of Bmal1 targets, Nr1d1 and Ppat.

Using biochemical and single molecule chromatin fibre approaches, we show that G9a together with SUV39h1 induces chromatin compaction by accumulating the repressive modifications, H3K9me1/me2/me3, in the vicinity of stressed replication forks. This closed conformation is also favoured by the G9a-dependent exclusion of the H3K9-demethylase JMJD1A/KDM3A, which facilitates heterochromatin disassembly upon fork restart. Untimely heterochromatin disassembly from stressed forks by KDM3A enables PRIMPOL access, triggering single-stranded DNA gap formation and sensitizing cells towards chemotherapeutic drugs.

Here we found that expression of fatty acid transporters and of the rate-limiting enzyme involved in β-oxidation is decreased in cells expressing a hyperactive mutant of the small GTPase Arf1, leading to an accumulation of fatty acids in lipid droplets. Consequently, mitochondria became fragmented and ATP synthesis decreased. Genetic and pharmacological depletion of fatty acids phenocopied the arf1 mutant mitochondrial phenotype.

Time-lapse imaging shows that NDRG1, but not the phosphorylation-deficient NDRG1Ser336Ala mutant, engages with mitochondria to facilitate fission in control cells, as well as in those lacking DRP1.

Here we show that cytosolic glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1 clusters with CAD and UMPS, and this complex then connects with DHODH, which is mediated by the mitochondrial outer membrane protein voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 3. Therefore, these proteins form a multi-enzyme complex, named ‘pyrimidinosome’, involving AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a regulator. Activated AMPK dissociates from the complex to enhance pyrimidinosome assembly but inactivated UMPS, which promotes DHODH-mediated ferroptosis defence. Meanwhile, cancer cells with lower expression of AMPK are more reliant on pyrimidinosome-mediated UMP biosynthesis and more vulnerable to its inhibition.

The LDLR protein is highly expressed in the steroidogenic organs and LDL cholesterol is an important source for steroidogenesis. Cholesterol must be transported into the mitochondria, where steroid hormone biosynthesis initiates. However, how LDL cholesterol is conveyed to the mitochondria is poorly defined. Here, through genome-wide small hairpin RNA screening, we find that the outer mitochondrial membrane protein phospholipase D6 (PLD6), which hydrolyses cardiolipin to phosphatidic acid, accelerates LDLR degradation. PLD6 promotes the entrance of LDL and LDLR into the mitochondria, where LDLR is degraded by mitochondrial proteases and LDL-carried cholesterol is used for steroid hormone biosynthesis. Mechanistically, the outer mitochondrial membrane protein CISD2 binds to the cytosolic tail of LDLR and tethers LDLR+ vesicles to the mitochondria. The fusogenic lipid phosphatidic acid generated by PLD6 facilitates the membrane fusion of LDLR+ vesicles with the mitochondria. This intracellular transport pathway of LDL–LDLR bypasses the lysosomes and delivers cholesterol to the mitochondria for steroidogenesis.","2023-07","2024-05-27 22:35:49","2024-05-28 05:04:10","2024-05-27 22:35:49","937-949","","7","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/SHPFIBU9/Zhou et al. - 2023 - Delivery of low-density lipoprotein from endocytic.pdf","","No problem","Lipids; Membrane trafficking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we report that autophagy is activated in microglia, particularly of disease-associated microglia surrounding amyloid plaques in AD mouse models. Inhibition of microglial autophagy causes disengagement of microglia from amyloid plaques, suppression of disease-associated microglia, and aggravation of neuropathology in AD mice. Mechanistically, autophagy deficiency promotes senescence-associated microglia as evidenced by reduced proliferation, increased Cdkn1a/p21Cip1, dystrophic morphologies and senescence-associated secretory phenotype.

Thermogenic stimulation selectively promotes mitochondrial proteostasis in mature white adipocytes via the mitochondrial protease LONP1. Disruption of LONP1-dependent proteolysis substantially impairs cold- or β3 adrenergic agonist-induced white-to-beige identity switching of mature adipocytes. Mechanistically, LONP1 selectively degrades succinate dehydrogenase complex iron sulfur subunit B and ensures adequate intracellular succinate levels. This alters the histone methylation status on thermogenic genes and thereby enables adipocyte cell fate programming. Finally, augmented LONP1 expression raises succinate levels and corrects ageing-related impairments in white-to-beige adipocyte conversion and adipocyte thermogenic capacity. Together, these findings reveal that LONP1 links proteolytic surveillance to mitochondrial metabolic rewiring and directs cell identity conversion during adipocyte thermogenic remodelling.","2023-06","2024-05-27 22:35:49","2024-05-28 05:15:00","2024-05-27 22:35:49","848-864","","6","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/CEQD5WKV/Fu et al. - 2023 - Proteolytic rewiring of mitochondria by LONP1 dire.pdf","","No problem","Cell biology; Mitochondria","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We developed dedicated regression-based methods to analyse ribosome profiling and alternative polyadenylation data, and identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC) as a translational controller of a specific mRNA regulon. We found that HNRNPC is downregulated in highly metastatic cells, which causes HNRNPC-bound mRNAs to undergo 3′ untranslated region lengthening and, subsequently, translational repression.

Importantly, CKB acts as a protein kinase and phosphorylates GPX4 S104. This phosphorylation prevents HSC70 binding to GPX4, thereby abrogating the GPX4 degradation regulated by chaperone-mediated autophagy, alleviating ferroptosis and promoting tumour growth in mice. In addition, the levels of GPX4 are positively correlated with the phosphorylation levels of CKB T133 and GPX4 S104 in human hepatocellular carcinoma specimens and associated with poor prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

MUFAs upregulate the number of lipid droplets in fat storage tissues. Increased lipid droplet number is necessary for MUFA-induced longevity and predicts remaining lifespan. Lipidomics datasets reveal that MUFAs also modify the ratio of membrane lipids and ether lipids—a signature associated with decreased lipid oxidation. In agreement with this, MUFAs decrease lipid oxidation in middle-aged individuals. Intriguingly, MUFAs upregulate not only lipid droplet number but also peroxisome number. A targeted screen identifies genes involved in the co-regulation of lipid droplets and peroxisomes, and reveals that induction of both organelles is optimal for longevity.

GINS organoids acquired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in 10 days and restored glucose homeostasis for over 100 days in diabetic mice after transplantation, providing proof of concept for a promising approach to treat diabetes.","2023-05","2024-05-27 22:35:49","2024-05-28 05:22:01","2024-05-27 22:35:49","778-786","","5","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ZE3ZBIJ5/Huang et al. - 2023 - Stomach-derived human insulin-secreting organoids .pdf","","No problem","Adult stem cells; Regeneration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, we have limited understanding of how the transition to a formative state is molecularly controlled. Here we used murine embryonic stem cell models to show that ESRRB is both required and sufficient to activate formative genes. Genetic inactivation of Esrrb leads to illegitimate expression of mesendoderm and extra-embryonic markers, impaired formative expression and failure to self-organize in 3D. Functionally, this results in impaired ability to generate formative stem cells and primordial germ cells in the absence of Esrrb. Computational modelling and genomic analyses revealed that ESRRB occupies key formative genes in naive cells and throughout the formative state.

PBRM1-deficient PBAF complexes retain the association between SMARCA4 and ARID2, but have loosely tethered BRD7. The PBAF complexes redistribute from promoter proximal regions to distal enhancers containing NF-κB motifs, heightening NF-κB activity in PBRM1-deficient models and clinical samples. The ATPase function of SMARCA4 maintains chromatin occupancy of pre-existing and newly acquired RELA specific to PBRM1 loss, activating downstream target gene expression. Proteasome inhibitor bortezomib abrogates RELA occupancy, suppresses NF-κB activation and delays growth of PBRM1-deficient tumours.

Disruption of the stem state exit has catastrophic consequences for embryogenesis and can lead to cancer. While some elements of this stem state switch are known, major regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that this switch involves a global increase in splicing efficiency coordinated by DNA methyltransferase 3α (DNMT3A), an enzyme typically involved in DNA methylation. Proper activation of murine and human embryonic and haematopoietic stem cells depends on messenger RNA processing, influenced by DNMT3A in response to stimuli. DNMT3A coordinates splicing through recruitment of the core spliceosome protein SF3B1 to RNA polymerase and mRNA. Importantly, the DNA methylation function of DNMT3A is not required and loss of DNMT3A leads to impaired splicing during stem cell turnover. Finally, we identify the spliceosome as a potential therapeutic target in DNMT3A-mutated leukaemias. Together, our results reveal a modality through which DNMT3A and the spliceosome govern exit from the stem state towards differentiation.","2023-04","2024-05-27 22:35:49","2024-05-28 05:28:13","2024-05-27 22:35:50","528-539","","4","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/MPNJ8G74/Ramabadran et al. - 2023 - DNMT3A-coordinated splicing governs the stem state.pdf","","Log","Haematopoietic stem cells; Reprogramming; Embryonic stem cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, to better understand this unusual landscape’s molecular properties, we genetically and chemically perturbed major epigenetic pathways in mouse trophoblast stem cells. We find that the extra-embryonic epigenome reflects ongoing and dynamic de novo methyltransferase recruitment, which is continuously antagonized by Polycomb to maintain intermediate, locally disordered methylation.

Here we systematically examined changes in transcript profiles caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection at different multiplicities of infection for lung airway organoids, lung alveolar organoids and cardiomyocytes, and identified several genes that are generally implicated in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, including CIART, the circadian-associated repressor of transcription. Lung airway organoids, lung alveolar organoids and cardiomyocytes derived from isogenic CIART−/− human pluripotent stem cells were significantly resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection, independently of viral entry. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis further validated the decreased levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ciliated-like cells of lung airway organoids. CUT&RUN, ATAC-seq and RNA-sequencing analyses showed that CIART controls SARS-CoV-2 infection at least in part through the regulation of NR4A1, a gene also identified from the multi-organoid analysis. Finally, transcriptional profiling and pharmacological inhibition led to the discovery that the Retinoid X Receptor pathway regulates SARS-CoV-2 infection downstream of CIART and NR4A1.

Upon emergence of cytosolic DNA, STING translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi where STING activates the downstream kinase TBK1, then to lysosome through recycling endosomes (REs) for its degradation. Although the molecular machinery of STING activation is extensively studied and defined, the one underlying STING degradation and inactivation has not yet been fully elucidated. Here we show that STING is degraded by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-driven microautophagy. Airyscan super-resolution microscopy and correlative light/electron microscopy suggest that STING-positive vesicles of an RE origin are directly encapsulated into Lamp1-positive compartments. Screening of mammalian Vps genes, the yeast homologues of which regulate Golgi-to-vacuole transport, shows that ESCRT proteins are essential for the STING encapsulation into Lamp1-positive compartments. Knockdown of Tsg101 and Vps4, components of ESCRT, results in the accumulation of STING vesicles in the cytosol, leading to the sustained type I interferon response. Knockdown of Tsg101 in human primary T cells leads to an increase the expression of interferon-stimulated genes. STING undergoes K63-linked ubiquitination at lysine 288 during its transit through the Golgi/REs, and this ubiquitination is required for STING degradation.

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 causes DNA damage and elicits an altered DNA damage response. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 proteins ORF6 and NSP13 cause degradation of the DNA damage response kinase CHK1 through proteasome and autophagy, respectively. CHK1 loss leads to deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) shortage, causing impaired S-phase progression, DNA damage, pro-inflammatory pathways activation and cellular senescence. Supplementation of deoxynucleosides reduces that. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 N-protein impairs 53BP1 focal recruitment by interfering with damage-induced long non-coding RNAs, thus reducing DNA repair. Key observations are recapitulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice and patients with COVID-19.

We further identify that a core set of transcription factors, enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) and nuclear factor I X (NFIX), coordinates with the cis-regulatory elements at the SMARCD3 locus to form a chromatin hub to control SMARCD3 expression in the developing cerebellum and in metastatic MB.

We demonstrate this by mistargeting the machinery for branched Actin dynamics using nanobodies and optogenetics. We can thereby engineer the cell shape with temporal precision and thus the daughter-cell size at different stages of cytokinesis. Most strikingly, inverting cortical Actin asymmetry causes an inversion of daughter-cell sizes.

Here we show that chromosome clustering is required to prevent chromosome losses in the long gap phase between nuclear envelope breakdown and the onset of spindle assembly, and to promote the rapid capture of all chromosomes by the acentrosomal spindle. The initial phase of chromosome clustering is driven by a dynamic network of Formin-2- and Spire-nucleated actin cables. The actin cables form in the disassembling nucleus and migrate towards the nuclear centre, moving the chromosomes centripetally by interacting with their arms and kinetochores as they migrate.

Mutagenesis and chimaera assays demonstrate that an intrinsically disordered region promotes oligomerization of the YAP fusions into nuclear, puncta-like, membrane-less condensates. Oligomerization and nuclear condensates induced by YAP fusion with a coiled-coil domain of transcriptional activator GCN4 also promote ependymoma formation. YAP-MAMLD1 concentrates transcription factors and co-activators, including BRD4, MED1 and TEAD, in condensates while excluding transcriptional repressive PRC2, and induces long-range enhancer–promoter interactions that promote transcription and oncogenic programmes.

However, it is not known whether this specific type of circuitry is equally crucial in all mutant TF-driven cancers. Here we describe an alternative yet central transcriptional mechanism that promotes Ewing sarcoma, wherein constraint, rather than reinforcement, of the activity of the fusion TF EWS–FLI supports cancer growth.

Dual localization of STARD7 to the intermembrane space of mitochondria and the cytosol upon cleavage by the rhomboid protease PARL ensures the synthesis of coenzyme Q in mitochondria and its transport to the plasma membrane. While mitochondrial STARD7 preserves coenzyme Q synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation function and cristae morphogenesis, cytosolic STARD7 is required for the transport of coenzyme Q to the plasma membrane and protects against ferroptosis. A coenzyme Q variant competes with phosphatidylcholine for binding to purified STARD7 in vitro. Overexpression of cytosolic STARD7 increases ferroptotic resistance of the cells, but limits coenzyme Q abundance in mitochondria and respiratory cell growth.

We find decreased numbers and functionality of osteoprogenitors at the endosteum and expansion of central marrow LepR+ mesenchymal stromal cells associated with deterioration of the sinusoidal vasculature. Together, they create a degraded and inflamed old bone marrow niche. Niche inflammation in turn drives the chronic activation of emergency myelopoiesis pathways in old HSCs and multipotent progenitors, which promotes myeloid differentiation and hinders haematopoietic regeneration. Moreover, we show how production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) by the damaged endosteum acts in trans to drive the proinflammatory nature of the central marrow, with damaging consequences for the old blood system. Notably, niche deterioration, HSC dysfunction and defective regeneration can all be ameliorated by blocking IL-1 signalling.

Pancreatic cancer cells gain LPAR4 expression in response to stress by downregulating a tumour suppressor, miR-139-5p. Even in the absence of exogenous lysophosphatidic acid, LPAR4-expressing tumour cells display an enrichment of extracellular matrix genes that are established drivers of cancer stemness. Mechanistically, upregulation of fibronectin via an LPAR4/AKT/CREB axis is indispensable for LPAR4-induced tumour initiation and stress tolerance. Moreover, ligation of this fibronectin-containing matrix via integrins α5β1 or αVβ3 can transfer stress tolerance to LPAR4-negative cells. Therefore, stress- or drug-induced LPAR4 enhances cell-autonomous production of a fibronectin-rich extracellular matrix, allowing cells to survive ‘isolation stress’ and compensate for the absence of stromal-derived factors by creating their own tumour-initiating niche.","2023-02","2024-05-27 22:36:33","2024-05-28 05:39:31","2024-05-27 22:36:33","309-322","","2","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/S7N7DQN9/Wu et al. - 2023 - Pancreatic cancer cells upregulate LPAR4 in respon.pdf","","Zero","Tumour biomarkers; Cancer microenvironment; Cancer stem cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Genetic loss or pharmacological inhibition of Menin unexpectedly phenocopies the effects of polycomb disruption, resulting in derepression of bivalent genes in both cancer cells and pluripotent stem cells. While Menin and KMT2A/B contribute to H3K4me3 at active genes, a separate Menin-independent function of KMT2A/B maintains H3K4me3 and opposes polycomb-mediated repression at bivalent genes. Release of KMT2A from active genes following Menin targeting alters the balance of polycomb and KMT2A at bivalent genes, facilitating gene activation. This functional partitioning of Menin–KMT2A/B complex components reveals therapeutic opportunities that can be leveraged through inhibition of Menin.","2023-02","2024-05-27 22:36:33","2024-05-28 05:40:11","2024-05-27 22:36:33","258-272","","2","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/K9Z27WJJ/Sparbier et al. - 2023 - Targeting Menin disrupts the KMT2AB and polycomb .pdf","","No problem","Cancer; Gene expression; Epigenetics; Stem cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) 1 and PRC2 have both been implicated in gene silencing, their exact roles in XCI during in vivo development have remained elusive. To this end, we have studied mouse embryos lacking either PRC1 or PRC2. Here we demonstrate that the loss of either PRC has a substantial impact on maintenance of gene silencing on the inactive X chromosome (Xi) in extra-embryonic tissues, with overlapping yet different genes affected, indicating potentially independent roles of the two complexes. Importantly, a lack of PRC1 does not affect PRC2/H3K27me3 accumulation and a lack of PRC2 does not impact PRC1/H2AK119ub1 accumulation on the Xi. Thus PRC1 and PRC2 contribute independently to the maintenance of XCI in early post-implantation extra-embryonic lineages, revealing that both Polycomb complexes can be directly involved and differently deployed in XCI.","2023-01","2024-05-27 22:36:33","2024-05-28 05:49:53","2024-05-27 22:36:33","134-144","","1","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/U3P82LS7/Masui et al. - 2023 - Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 are each ess.pdf","","No problem","Epigenetic memory; Dosage compensation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many aspects of DNA methylation maintenance have been characterized; however, the exact kinetics of post-replicative methylation maintenance remain a subject of debate. Here we develop isolation of DNA by 5-ethynyl-deoxyuridine labelling for mass spectrometry (iDEMS), a highly sensitive, quantitative mass spectrometry-based method for measuring DNA modifications on metabolically labelled DNA. iDEMS reveals an unexpectedly hemi-methylated landscape on nascent DNA. Combining iDEMS with metabolic labelling reveals that methylation maintenance is outpaced by cell division in mouse embryonic stem cells. Our approach shows that hydroxymethylation is perpetually asymmetric between sister strands in favour of the parental, template strand. iDEMS can be coupled with immunoprecipitation of chromatin proteins, revealing features of DNA methylation–histone modification crosstalk and suggesting a model for interplay between methylation and nucleosome assembly. iDEMS therefore elucidates long-standing questions about DNA modification propagation and provides an important orthogonal technology to understanding this process in dynamic cellular contexts.","2023-01","2024-05-27 22:36:33","2024-05-28 05:48:34","2024-05-27 22:36:33","183-193","","1","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/XM6IJQRA/Stewart-Morgan et al. - 2023 - Quantifying propagation of DNA methylation and hyd.pdf","","No problem","Post-translational modifications; Chromatin; DNA methylation; Embryonic stem cells; DNA replication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We discovered increased expression of the inner nuclear membrane protein LAP1 in metastatic melanoma cells, at the invasive front of human primary melanoma tumours and in metastases. Human cells express two LAP1 isoforms (LAP1B and LAP1C), which differ in their amino terminus. Here, using in vitro and in vivo models that recapitulate human melanoma progression, we found that expression of the shorter isoform, LAP1C, supports nuclear envelope blebbing, constrained migration and invasion by allowing a weaker coupling between the nuclear envelope and the nuclear lamina.

Ablation of PD-1-expressing cells, deletion of PD-1 in T-ALL cells or blockade of PD-1 or PD-1 ligand 1 significantly eradicated LSCs and suppressed disease progression. Combination therapy using PD-1 blockade and chemotherapy substantially extended the survival of mice engrafted with mouse or human T-ALL cells. Mechanistically, PD-1+ LSCs had high NOTCH1–MYC activity for disease initiation. Furthermore, PD-1 signalling maintained quiescence and protected LSCs against T cell receptor-signal-induced apoptosis. Overall, our data highlight the hierarchy of leukaemia by identifying PD-1+ LSCs and provide a therapeutic approach for the elimination of LSCs through PD-1 blockade in T-ALL.","2023-01","2024-05-27 22:36:33","2024-05-28 05:47:29","2024-05-27 22:36:33","170-182","","1","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/3EDGE4EY/Xu et al. - 2023 - PD-1 signalling defines and protects leukaemic ste.pdf","","No problem","Tumour immunology; Cell death and immune response; Immunotherapy; Cancer stem cells","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we show that ZFP462 safeguards neural lineage specification of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by targeting the H3K9-specific histone methyltransferase complex G9A/GLP to silence meso-endodermal genes. ZFP462 binds to transposable elements that are potential enhancers harbouring pluripotency and meso-endoderm transcription factor binding sites. Recruiting G9A/GLP, ZFP462 seeds heterochromatin, restricting transcription factor binding. Loss of ZFP462 in ESCs results in increased chromatin accessibility at target sites and ectopic expression of meso-endodermal genes. Taken together, ZFP462 confers lineage and locus specificity to the broadly expressed epigenetic regulator G9A/GLP. Our results suggest that aberrant activation of lineage non-specific genes in the neuronal lineage underlies ZNF462-associated neurodevelopmental pathology.","2023-01","2024-05-27 22:36:33","2024-05-28 05:46:25","2024-05-27 22:36:33","42-55","","1","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/JBNAKLVA/Yelagandula et al. - 2023 - ZFP462 safeguards neural lineage specification by .pdf","","No problem","Gene silencing; Transcriptional regulatory elements; Embryonic stem cells; Cell lineage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the mechanisms governing the hybrid EMT state remain poorly defined. Here we showed that deletion of the epigenetic regulator MLL3, a tumour suppressor frequently altered in human cancer, promoted the acquisition of hybrid EMT in breast cancer cells. Distinct from other EMT regulators that mediate only unidirectional changes, MLL3 loss enhanced responses to stimuli inducing EMT and mesenchymal–epithelial transition in epithelial and mesenchymal cells, respectively. Consequently, MLL3 loss greatly increased metastasis by enhancing metastatic colonization. Mechanistically, MLL3 loss led to increased IFNγ signalling, which contributed to the induction of hybrid EMT cells and enhanced metastatic capacity. Furthermore, BET inhibition effectively suppressed the growth of MLL3-mutant primary tumours and metastases. These results uncovered MLL3 mutation as a key driver of hybrid EMT and metastasis in breast cancer that could be targeted therapeutically.","2023-01","2024-05-27 22:36:33","2024-05-28 05:52:20","2024-05-27 22:36:33","145-158","","1","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/DTTT6WSL/Cui et al. - 2023 - MLL3 loss drives metastasis by promoting a hybrid .pdf","","No problem","Breast cancer; Cancer epigenetics; Metastasis; Epithelial–mesenchymal transition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RIPK3 self-oligomerization and autophosphorylation are prerequisites for executing necroptosis, yet the underlying mechanism of virus-induced RIPK3 activation remains elusive. Interferon-inducible 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OASL) protein is devoid of enzymatic function but displays potent antiviral activity. Here we describe a role of OASL as a virus-induced necroptosis promoter that scaffolds the RIPK3–ZBP1 non-canonical necrosome via liquid-like phase condensation. This liquid-like platform of OASL recruits RIPK3 and ZBP1 via protein–protein interactions to provide spatial segregation for RIPK3 nucleation. This process facilitates the amyloid-like fibril formation and activation of RIPK3 and thereby MLKL phosphorylation for necroptosis. Mice deficient in Oasl1 exhibit severely impaired necroptosis and attenuated inflammation after viral infection, resulting in uncontrolled viral dissemination and lethality. Our study demonstrates an interferon-induced innate response whereby OASL scaffolds RIPK3–ZBP1 assembly via its phase-separated liquid droplets to facilitate necroptosis-mediated antiviral immunity.","2023-01","2024-05-27 22:36:33","2024-05-28 05:50:30","2024-05-27 22:36:33","92-107","","1","25","","Nat Cell Biol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/NFDI9Q2E/Lee et al. - 2023 - OASL phase condensation induces amyloid-like fibri.pdf","","No problem","Cell death and immune response; Necroptosis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
