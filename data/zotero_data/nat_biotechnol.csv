However, the scale and heterogeneous nature of multi-modal data makes integration and inference a non-trivial task. We developed a deep-learning-based framework, multi-omics variational autoencoders (MOVE), to integrate such data and applied it to a cohort of 789 people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with deep multi-omics phenotyping from the DIRECT consortium. Using in silico perturbations, we identified drug–omics associations across the multi-modal datasets for the 20 most prevalent drugs given to people with type 2 diabetes with substantially higher sensitivity than univariate statistical tests. From these, we among others, identified novel associations between metformin and the gut microbiota as well as opposite molecular responses for the two statins, simvastatin and atorvastatin. We used the associations to quantify drug–drug similarities, assess the degree of polypharmacy and conclude that drug effects are distributed across the multi-omics modalities.","2023-03","2024-06-11 01:00:48","2024-06-11 01:00:48","2024-03-07 06:52:25","399-408","","3","41","","Nat Biotechnol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/6QFR9KNJ/Allesøe et al. - 2023 - Discovery of drug–omics associations in type 2 dia.pdf","","No problem","Machine learning; Systems biology; Data integration; Type 2 diabetes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The approach depends on our identification of ACTIVIN A in regulating LC-NE transcription factors in dorsal rhombomere 1 (r1) progenitors. In vitro generated human LC-NE neurons display extensive axonal arborization; release and uptake NE; and exhibit pacemaker activity, calcium oscillation and chemoreceptor activity in response to CO2.

High transduction of non-immunogenic transgenes was achieved, although expression declined over the first 90 days to reach a lower but stable steady state. More than 10% of hepatocytes contained single nuclear domains of vector DNA that persisted despite the loss of transgene expression. Greater reductions in vector DNA and RNA were observed with immunogenic transgenes. Genomic integration of vector sequences, including complex concatemeric structures, were detected in 1 out of 100 cells at broadly distributed loci that were not in proximity to genes associated with hepatocellular carcinoma.

Compressed Perturb-seq measures multiple random perturbations per cell or multiple cells per droplet and computationally decompresses these measurements by leveraging the sparse structure of regulatory circuits. Applied to 598 genes in the immune response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, compressed Perturb-seq achieves the same accuracy as conventional Perturb-seq with an order of magnitude cost reduction and greater power to learn genetic interactions.

We present a simple, fast instrument-free method for aptamer enrichment and selection based on a diffusion-binding process in a three-dimensional non-fouling porous hydrogel with immobilized target proteins. Low-affinity aptamer candidates can be rapidly released from the hydrogel, whereas high-affinity candidates are restricted due to their strong binding to the immobilized protein targets. Consequently, a one-step enriched aptamer pool can strongly bind the protein targets. This enrichment is consistent across five proteins with isoelectric points in varying ranges.

We address these concerns with Spectra, an algorithm that combines user-provided gene programs with the detection of novel programs that together best explain expression covariation. Spectra incorporates existing gene sets and cell-type labels as prior biological information, explicitly models cell type and represents input gene sets as a gene–gene knowledge graph using a penalty function to guide factorization toward the input graph. We show that Spectra outperforms existing approaches in challenging tumor immune contexts, as it finds factors that change under immune checkpoint therapy, disentangles the highly correlated features of CD8+ T cell tumor reactivity and exhaustion, finds a program that explains continuous macrophage state changes under therapy and identifies cell-type-specific immune metabolic programs.","2023-09-21","2024-06-11 01:00:48","2024-06-11 01:00:48","2024-05-26 17:22:38","1-12","","","","","Nat Biotechnol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/A3AP3UJ8/Kunes et al. - 2023 - Supervised discovery of interpretable gene program.pdf","","No problem","Cancer immunotherapy; Computational models; Breast cancer; Genetic databases; Immunosurveillance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By measuring Na+ at single endosome resolution in mammalian cells and Caenorhabditis elegans, we discovered that lumenal Na+ levels in each stage of the endolysosomal pathway exceed cytosolic levels and decrease as endosomes mature. Further, we find that lysosomal Na+ levels in nematodes are modulated by the Na+/H+ exchanger NHX-5 in response to salt stress.

Here we have overcome these limitations by fusing the miRNA effector protein Argonaute2 to the RNA editing domain of ADAR2, allowing the detection of miRNA targets transcriptome-wide in single cells. miRNAs guide the fusion protein to their natural target transcripts, causing them to undergo A>I editing, which can be detected by sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing. We show that agoTRIBE identifies functional miRNA targets, which are supported by evolutionary sequence conservation.

Here we show that the introduction of sets of charges in the lumen of the CytK nanopore spaced by ~1 nm creates an electroosmotic flow that induces the unidirectional transport of unstructured natural polypeptides against a strong electrophoretic force. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that this electroosmotic-dominated force has a strength of ~20 pN at −100 mV, which is similar to the electric force on single-stranded DNA. Unfolded polypeptides produce current signatures as they traverse the nanopore, which may be used to identify proteins.

Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics show that somitic and spinal cord differentiation trajectories organize along this axis and can self-assemble into a neural tube surrounded by somites upon extracellular matrix addition. Morphogenesis is coupled with AP patterning mechanisms, which results, at later stages of organogenesis, in in vivo-like arrays of neural subtypes along a neural tube surrounded by spine and muscle progenitors contacted by neuronal projections.

To improve HDR efficiency, we screened six small-molecule inhibitors of DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), a key protein in the alternative repair pathway of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which generates genomic insertions/deletions (INDELs). From this screen, we identified AZD7648 as the most potent compound. The use of AZD7648 significantly increased HDR (up to 50-fold) and concomitantly decreased INDELs across different genomic loci in various therapeutically relevant primary human cell types. In all cases, the ratio of HDR to INDELs markedly increased, and, in certain situations, INDEL-free high-frequency (>50%) targeted integration was achieved. This approach has the potential to improve the therapeutic efficacy of cell-based therapies and broaden the use of targeted integration as a research tool.","2024-05","2024-06-11 01:00:48","2024-06-11 01:00:48","2024-05-26 17:22:39","731-744","","5","42","","Nat Biotechnol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/QSXZTJSS/Selvaraj et al. - 2024 - High-efficiency transgene integration by homology-.pdf","","No problem","Genetic engineering; Stem-cell biotechnology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Applying PhyloVelo to seven lineage-traced scRNA-seq datasets, generated using CRISPR–Cas9 editing, lentiviral barcoding or immune repertoire profiling, demonstrates its high accuracy and robustness in inferring complex lineage trajectories while outperforming RNA velocity.

The WT hGPCs outcompeted and ultimately eliminated their human Huntington’s disease (HD) counterparts, repopulating the host striata with healthy glia. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that WT hGPCs acquired a YAP1/MYC/E2F-defined dominant competitor phenotype upon interaction with the host HD glia. WT hGPCs also outcompeted older resident isogenic WT cells that had been transplanted neonatally, suggesting that competitive success depended primarily on the relative ages of competing populations, rather than on the presence of mHTT.

Phanta, a virome-inclusive gut microbiome profiling tool, overcomes the limitations of assembly-based viral profiling methods by using customized k-mer-based classification tools and incorporating recently published catalogs of gut viral genomes. Phanta’s optimizations consider the small genome size of viruses, sequence homology with prokaryotes and interactions with other gut microbes. Extensive testing of Phanta on simulated data demonstrates that it quickly and accurately quantifies prokaryotes and viruses. When applied to 245 fecal metagenomes from healthy adults, Phanta identifies ~200 viral species per sample, ~5× more than standard assembly-based methods. We observe a ~2:1 ratio between DNA viruses and bacteria, with higher interindividual variability of the gut virome compared to the gut bacteriome. In another cohort, we observe that Phanta performs equally well on bulk versus virus-enriched metagenomes, making it possible to study prokaryotes and viruses in a single experiment, with a single analysis.","2024-04","2024-06-11 01:00:48","2024-06-11 01:00:48","2024-05-26 17:23:39","651-662","","4","42","","Nat Biotechnol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/RY5XLB4H/Pinto et al. - 2024 - Phage-inclusive profiling of human gut microbiomes.pdf","","Others","Genomics; Metagenomics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The signal output of ARPLA occurs only when dual recognition of a glycan and an RNA triggers in situ ligation, followed by rolling circle amplification of a complementary DNA, which generates a fluorescent signal by binding fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotides. Using ARPLA, we detect spatial distributions of glycoRNAs on the cell surface and their colocalization with lipid rafts as well as the intracellular trafficking of glycoRNAs through SNARE protein-mediated secretory exocytosis. Studies in breast cell lines suggest that surface glycoRNA is inversely associated with tumor malignancy and metastasis.

Combining mitochondria-localized, programmable TALE binding proteins with the nickase MutH or Nt.BspD6I(C) and either the single-stranded DNA-specific adenine deaminase TadA8e or the cytosine deaminase ABOBEC1 and UGI, we achieve A-to-G or C-to-T base editing with up to 77% efficiency and high specificity.

Constructing a pangenome graph directly from assemblies, as opposed to variant calls, leverages the graph’s ability to represent variation at different scales. Here we present the Minigraph-Cactus pangenome pipeline, which creates pangenomes directly from whole-genome alignments, and demonstrate its ability to scale to 90 human haplotypes from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium.

There is increasing evidence that measurement of the total count and concentration of microbes in the gut, or ‘absolute abundance’, provides a richer source of information than relative abundance and can correct some conclusions drawn from relative abundance data. However, little is known about how preservative choice can affect these measurements. In this study, we investigated how two common preservatives and short-term storage conditions impact relative and absolute microbial measurements. OMNIgene GUT OMR-200 yields lower metagenomic taxonomic variation between different storage temperatures, whereas Zymo DNA/RNA Shield yields lower metatranscriptomic taxonomic variation. Absolute abundance quantification reveals two different causes of variable Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratios across preservatives.

In a benchmark encompassing a broad variety of datasets, Read2Tree is 10–100 times faster than assembly-based approaches and in most cases more accurate—the exception being when sequencing coverage is high and reference species very distant. Here, to illustrate the broad applicability of the tool, we reconstruct a yeast tree of life of 435 species spanning 590 million years of evolution.

However, it is not yet possible to quantify the impact of chromatin context on transcription factor binding affinities. Here, we report a method called binding affinities to native chromatin by sequencing (BANC-seq) to determine absolute apparent binding affinities of transcription factors to native DNA across the genome. In BANC-seq, a concentration range of a tagged transcription factor is added to isolated nuclei. Concentration-dependent binding is then measured per sample to quantify apparent binding affinities across the genome. BANC-seq adds a quantitative dimension to transcription factor biology, which enables stratification of genomic targets based on transcription factor concentration and prediction of transcription factor binding sites under non-physiological conditions, such as disease-associated overexpression of (onco)genes. Notably, whereas consensus DNA binding motifs for transcription factors are important to establish high-affinity binding sites, these motifs are not always strictly required to generate nanomolar-affinity interactions in the genome.","2023-12","2024-06-11 01:00:48","2024-06-11 01:00:48","2024-05-26 17:23:39","1801-1809","","12","41","","Nat Biotechnol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/L3LP2LUC/Neikes et al. - 2023 - Quantification of absolute transcription factor bi.pdf","","Log","Epigenomics; Functional genomics; Chromatin; Transcriptional regulatory elements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using six different human cell lines, six proteases, deep fractionation and three tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation methods, we identify a million unique peptides from 17,717 protein groups, with a median sequence coverage of approximately 80%. Direct comparison with RNA expression data provides evidence for the translation of most nonsynonymous variants. We have also hypothesized that undetected variants likely arise from mutation-induced protein instability.

Cells expressing these receptors can distinguish between varying tensile forces and respond by enacting customizable transcriptional programs.

Using genomic distances separating imaged loci, our aligner estimates spatial distances expected to separate loci on a polymer in three-dimensional space. Our aligner then evaluates the physical probability observed signals belonging to these loci are connected, thereby tracing chromatin structures. We demonstrate that this spatial genome aligner can efficiently model chromosome architectures from DNA FISH data across multiple scales and be used to predict chromosome ploidies de novo in interphase cells.

Existing methods for major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) ligand discovery are time intensive, specialized and unable to interrogate specific proteins on a large scale. Here, we present EpiScan, which uses surface MHC class I levels as a readout for whether a genetically encoded peptide is an MHC class I ligand. Predetermined starting pools composed of >100,000 peptides can be designed using oligonucleotide synthesis, permitting large-scale MHC class I screening. We exploit this programmability of EpiScan to uncover an unappreciated role for cysteine that increases the number of predicted ligands by 9–21%, reveal affinity hierarchies by analysis of biased anchor peptide libraries and screen viral proteomes for MHC class I ligands. Using these data, we generate and iteratively refine peptide binding predictions to create EpiScan Predictor. EpiScan Predictor performs comparably to other state-of-the-art MHC class I peptide binding prediction algorithms without suffering from underrepresentation of cysteine-containing peptides. Thus, targeted immunopeptidomics using EpiScan will accelerate CD8+ T cell epitope discovery toward the goal of individual-specific immunotherapeutics.","2023-07","2024-06-11 01:00:48","2024-06-11 01:00:48","2024-05-26 17:25:39","980-992","","7","41","","Nat Biotechnol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/GYTHCLYH/Bruno et al. - 2023 - High-throughput, targeted MHC class I immunopeptid.pdf","","No problem","Applied immunology; Antigen processing and presentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we present BOSS-RUNS, an algorithmic framework and software to generate dynamically updated decision strategies. We quantify uncertainty at each genome position with real-time updates from data already observed. For each DNA fragment, we decide whether the expected decrease in uncertainty that it would provide warrants fully sequencing it, thus optimizing information gain. BOSS-RUNS mitigates coverage bias between and within members of a microbial community, leading to improved variant calling; for example, low-coverage sites of a species at 1% abundance were reduced by 87.5%, with 12.5% more single-nucleotide polymorphisms detected. Such data-driven updates to molecule selection are applicable to many sequencing scenarios, such as enriching for regions with increased divergence or low coverage, reducing time-to-answer.","2023-07","2024-06-11 01:00:48","2024-06-11 01:00:48","2024-05-26 17:25:39","1018-1025","","7","41","","Nat Biotechnol","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/FDLAF44W/Weilguny et al. - 2023 - Dynamic, adaptive sampling during nanopore sequenc.pdf","","No problem","Genetics research; Next-generation sequencing; Data acquisition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When CD64 expression was combined with hypoimmune genetic modifications known to protect against cellular immunity, B2M−/−CIITA−/− CD47/CD64-transgenic iECs were resistant to both IgG antibody-mediated and cellular immune killing in vitro and in humanized mice. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that CD64 or its intracellularly truncated analog CD64t effectively capture monomeric IgG and occupy their Fc, and the IgG bind and occupy their target antigens.

Here, we present a strategy for rapid isolation of highly peptide-specific and ‘MHC-restricted’ Abs by re-engineering preselected Abs that engage peptide–MHC in a manner structurally similar to that of conventional αβ-TCRs. We created structure-based libraries focused on the peptide-interacting residues of TCRm Ab complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops, and rapidly generated MHC-restricted Abs to both mouse and human tumor antigens that specifically killed target cells when formatted as IgG, bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) and chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T).

Here we overcome both limitations by engineering new CASTs with improved integration product purity and genome-wide specificity. To do so, we engineered a nicking homing endonuclease fusion to TnsB (named HELIX) to restore the 5′ nicking capability needed for cargo excision on the DNA donor. HELIX enables cut-and-paste DNA insertion with up to 99.4% simple insertion product purity, while retaining robust integration efficiencies on genomic targets. HELIX has substantially higher on-target specificity than canonical CASTs, and we identify several novel factors that further regulate targeted and genome-wide integration.
