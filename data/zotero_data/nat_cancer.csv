Aggressive cancers like high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have a high frequency of CIN and TP53 mutations. Here, we show that inhibitors of the KIF18A motor protein activate the mitotic checkpoint and selectively kill chromosomally unstable cancer cells. Sensitivity to KIF18A inhibition is enriched in TP53-mutant HGSOC and TNBC cell lines with CIN features, including in a subset of CCNE1-amplified, CDK4–CDK6-inhibitor-resistant and BRCA1-altered cell line models. Our KIF18A inhibitors have minimal detrimental effects on human bone marrow cells in culture, distinct from other anti-mitotic agents. In mice, inhibition of KIF18A leads to robust anti-cancer effects with tumor regression observed in human HGSOC and TNBC models at well-tolerated doses. Collectively, our results provide a rational therapeutic strategy for selective targeting of CIN cancers via KIF18A inhibition.","2024-01","2024-06-11 00:52:23","2024-06-11 00:52:23","2024-05-27 00:50:35","66-84","","1","5","","Nat Cancer","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/SJLS8G2N/Payton et al. - 2024 - Small-molecule inhibition of kinesin KIF18A reveal.pdf","","No problem","Cancer; Target identification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This model includes patient-to-patient variability in best single-drug response plus the weaker drug per patient. Among US Food and Drug Administration approvals of drug combinations for advanced cancers (1995–2020), 95% exhibited additive or less than additive effects on PFS times. Among positive or negative phase 3 trials published between 2014–2018, every combination that improved PFS was expected to succeed by additivity (100% sensitivity) and most failures were expected to fail (78% specificity). This study shows synergy is neither a necessary nor common property of clinically effective drug combinations.

Furthermore, evaluation of paired bone marrow profiles, taken before and after eight cycles of carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone with daratumumab, shows that numbers of natural killer cells before treatment, high T cell receptor diversity before treatment, the disappearance of sustained immune activation (that is, B cells and T cells) and monocyte expansion over time are all predictive of sustained minimal residual disease negativity.

We find that DON significantly reduces asparagine production by inhibiting asparagine synthetase (ASNS), and that the effects of DON are rescued by asparagine. As a metabolic adaptation, PDAC cells upregulate ASNS expression in response to DON, and we show that ASNS levels are inversely correlated with DON efficacy.

Several such cancers, termed bivalve transmissible neoplasia (BTN), induce leukemia-like disease in marine bivalves. This is the case of BTN lineages affecting the common cockle, Cerastoderma edule, which inhabits the Atlantic coasts of Europe and northwest Africa. To investigate the evolution of cockle BTN, we collected 6,854 cockles, diagnosed 390 BTN tumors, generated a reference genome and assessed genomic variation across 61 tumors. Our analyses confirmed the existence of two BTN lineages with hemocytic origins. Mitochondrial variation revealed mitochondrial capture and host co-infection events. Mutational analyses identified lineage-specific signatures, one of which likely reflects DNA alkylation.

We identified a T cell receptor (TCR) reactive to the recurrent D835Y driver mutation in the FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (TCRFLT3D/Y). TCRFLT3D/Y-redirected T cells selectively eliminated primary human AML cells harboring the FLT3D835Y mutation in vitro and in vivo. TCRFLT3D/Y cells rejected both CD34+ and CD34− AML in mice engrafted with primary leukemia from patients, reaching minimal residual disease-negative levels, and eliminated primary CD34+ AML leukemia-propagating cells in vivo.

Hallmarks of white adipose tissue (WAT) remodeling, which often precedes weight loss, are impaired lipid storage, inflammation and eventually fibrosis. Tissue wasting occurs in response to tumor-secreted factors. Considering that the continuous endothelium in WAT is the first line of contact with circulating factors, we postulated whether the endothelium itself may orchestrate tissue remodeling. Here, we show using human and mouse cancer models that during precachexia, tumors overactivate Notch1 signaling in distant WAT endothelium. Sustained endothelial Notch1 signaling induces a WAT wasting phenotype in male mice through excessive retinoic acid production. Pharmacological blockade of retinoic acid signaling was sufficient to inhibit WAT wasting in a mouse cancer cachexia model. This demonstrates that cancer manipulates the endothelium at distant sites to mediate WAT wasting by altering angiocrine signals.","2023-11","2024-06-11 00:52:23","2024-06-11 00:52:23","2024-05-27 00:50:35","1544-1560","","11","4","","Nat Cancer","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/XY33SRE7/Taylor et al. - 2023 - Endothelial Notch1 signaling in white adipose tiss.pdf","","No problem","Cancer therapy; Cancer; Cancer metabolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We demonstrate that blocking ACSS2, switches cancer cells from acetate consumers to producers of acetate thereby freeing acetate for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to use as a fuel source. We show that acetate supplementation metabolically bolsters T-cell effector functions and proliferation. Targeting ACSS2 with CRISPR-Cas9 guides or a small-molecule inhibitor promotes an antitumor immune response and enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy in preclinical breast cancer models.

Here, using tractable mouse models for T-NHL and primary patient samples, we demonstrate that PD-1 signaling suppresses T cell malignancy by restricting glycolytic energy and acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) production. In addition, PD-1 inactivation enforces ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) activity, which generates extramitochondrial acetyl-CoA for histone acetylation to enable hyperactivity of activating protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factors. Conversely, pharmacological ACLY inhibition impedes aberrant AP-1 signaling in PD-1-deficient T-NHLs and is toxic to these cancers.

Importantly, myeloid cell-specific Kdm6b deletion enhanced proinflammatory pathways and improved survival in GBM tumor-bearing mice. Mechanistic studies showed that the absence of Kdm6b enhances antigen presentation, interferon response and phagocytosis in myeloid cells by inhibition of mediators of immune suppression including Mafb, Socs3 and Sirpa.

In contrast to other visceral tissues, cholinergic innervation in the hepatic parenchyma is poorly detected. It remains unclear whether there is any form of cholinergic regulation of liver cancer. Here, we show that cholinergic T cells curtail the development of liver cancer by supporting antitumor immune responses. In a mouse multihit model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we observed activation of the adaptive immune response and induction of two populations of CD4+ T cells expressing choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), including regulatory T cells and dysfunctional PD-1+ T cells. Tumor antigens drove the clonal expansion of these cholinergic T cells in HCC. Genetic ablation of Chat in T cells led to an increased prevalence of preneoplastic cells and exacerbated liver cancer due to compromised antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, the cholinergic activity intrinsic in T cells constrained Ca2+–NFAT signaling induced by T cell antigen receptor engagement. Without this cholinergic modulation, hyperactivated CD25+ T regulatory cells and dysregulated PD-1+ T cells impaired HCC immunosurveillance.

Here we found different BM niches for HSCs in MPN subtypes. JAK–STAT signaling differentially regulates CDC42-dependent HSC polarity, niche interaction and mutant cell expansion. Asymmetric HSC distribution causes differential BM niche remodeling: sinusoidal dilation in polycythemia vera and endosteal niche expansion in essential thrombocythemia. MPN development accelerates in a prematurely aged BM microenvironment, suggesting that the specialized niche can modulate mutant cell expansion. Finally, dissimilar HSC-niche interactions underpin variable clinical response to JAK inhibitor.

However, recent clinical disappointments in these IL-2 agonists have questioned this strategy. Here we show that both wild-type (IL-2wt) and IL-2Rβγ-attenuated (IL-2α-bias) agonists that preserve IL-2Rα (CD25) activities can effectively expand tumor-specific CD8+ T cells (TSTs) and exhibit better antitumor efficacy and safety than the ‘non-α’ counterpart (IL-2nα). Mechanistically, TSTs coexpress elevated CD25 and PD-1 and are more susceptible to stimulation by IL-2Rα-proficient agonists. Moreover, the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1 depends on activation of PD-1+CD25+ TSTs through autocrine IL-2–CD25 signaling. In individuals with cancer, a low IL-2 signature correlates with non-responsiveness to anti-PD-1 treatment. In mouse models, IL-2α-bias, but not IL-2nα, restores the IL-2 signature and synergizes with anti-PD-1 to eradicate large established tumors. These findings underscore the indispensable function of CD25 in IL-2-based immunotherapy and provide rationales for evaluating IL-2Rα-biased agonists in individuals with cancer.","2023-09","2024-06-11 00:52:23","2024-06-11 00:52:23","2024-05-27 00:50:36","1309-1325","","9","4","","Nat Cancer","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/CC6XV2GH/Wu et al. - 2023 - IL-2Rα-biased agonist enhances antitumor immunity .pdf","","No problem","Cancer; Cancer immunotherapy; Recombinant protein therapy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Massive stabilization of mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins is a cancer-specific event that could potentially mark precancerous cells, yet in vivo protein-level mutp53 reporters are lacking. Here we developed two transgenic protein-level mutp53 reporters, p53R172H–Akaluc and p53–mCherry, that faithfully mimic the dynamics and function of mutp53 proteins in vivo. Using these reporters, we identified and traced rare precancerous clones in deep noncancerous tissues in various cancer models. In classic mutp53-driven thymic lymphoma models, we found that precancerous clones exhibit broad chromosome number variations, upregulate precancerous stage-specific genes such as Ybx3 and enhance amino acid transport and metabolism. Inhibiting amino acid transporters downstream of Ybx3 at the early but not late stage effectively suppresses tumorigenesis and prolongs survival. Together, these protein-level mutp53 reporters reveal undercharacterized features and vulnerabilities of precancerous cells during early tumorigenesis, paving the way for precision cancer prevention.","2023-08","2024-06-11 00:52:23","2024-06-11 00:52:23","2024-05-27 00:50:36","1176-1192","","8","4","","Nat Cancer","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/LAWUCKWI/Yao et al. - 2023 - Protein-level mutant p53 reporters identify drugga.pdf","","No problem","Cancer; Cancer genetics; Cancer models; Cancer prevention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multiomic and target engagement analyses, combined with rescue experiments and in vitro and in vivo efficacy studies, revealed that WNTinib is superior to clinical KIs and inhibits KIT/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling at multiple nodes. Moreover, we demonstrate that reduced engagement on BRAF and p38α kinases by WNTinib relative to several multi-KIs is necessary to avoid compensatory feedback signaling—providing a durable and selective transcriptional repression of mutant β-catenin/Wnt targets through nuclear translocation of the EZH2 transcriptional repressor.

Likewise, a classically described mechanism of tumor immune escape is tumor MHC-I downregulation. Here, we report that CD8+ T cells maintain the capacity to kill tumor cells that are entirely devoid of MHC-I expression. This capacity proves to be dependent instead on interactions between T cell natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) and tumor NKG2D ligands (NKG2DLs), the latter of which are highly expressed on MHC-loss variants. Necessarily, tumor cell killing in these instances is antigen independent, although prior T cell antigen-specific activation is required and can be furnished by myeloid cells or even neighboring MHC-replete tumor cells. In this manner, adaptive priming can beget innate killing. These mechanisms are active in vivo in mice as well as in vitro in human tumor systems and are obviated by NKG2D knockout or blockade. These studies challenge the long-advanced notion that downregulation of MHC-I is a viable means of tumor immune escape and instead identify the NKG2D–NKG2DL axis as a therapeutic target for enhancing T cell-dependent anti-tumor immunity against MHC-loss variants.","2023-09","2024-06-11 00:52:23","2024-06-11 00:52:23","2024-05-27 00:50:36","1258-1272","","9","4","","Nat Cancer","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/GV2ISBDR/Lerner et al. - 2023 - CD8+ T cells maintain killing of MHC-I-negative tu.pdf","","No problem","Tumour immunology; Cancer; Cancer immunotherapy; Cancer therapeutic resistance; CNS cancer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accordingly, high neutrophil infiltration correlated with clinical response specifically to dual ICI, and tumor-associated neutrophils also showed strong IL-17–TH17 pathway activity and T cell activation capacity. Both the blockade of IL-17A and the depletion of neutrophils impaired dual-ICI response and decreased T cell activation.

Here we show that mitochondria transfer is a prevalent phenomenon in glioblastoma (GBM), the most frequent and malignant primary brain tumor. We identified horizontal mitochondria transfer from astrocytes as a mechanism that enhances tumorigenesis in GBM. This transfer is dependent on network-forming intercellular connections between GBM cells and astrocytes, which are facilitated by growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), a protein involved in neuron axon regeneration and astrocyte reactivity. The acquisition of astrocyte mitochondria drives an increase in mitochondrial respiration and upregulation of metabolic pathways linked to proliferation and tumorigenicity. Functionally, uptake of astrocyte mitochondria promotes cell cycle progression to proliferative G2/M phases and enhances self-renewal and tumorigenicity of GBM.

Knockdown of either NQO1 or NQO1-AS reduced lung colonization in a mouse model, and investigation into the role of NQO1 indicated that it is broadly protective against oxidative damage and ferroptosis. Breast cancer cells in the lung are dependent on this pathway, and this dependence can be exploited therapeutically by inducing ferroptosis while inhibiting NQO1.

In the present study, we found that the pancreas tumor microenvironment suppresses NK cell and T cell surveillance after therapy-induced senescence through enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)-mediated epigenetic repression of proinflammatory SASP genes. EZH2 blockade stimulated production of SASP chemokines CCL2 and CXCL9/10, leading to enhanced NK cell and T cell infiltration and PDAC eradication in mouse models. EZH2 activity was also associated with suppression of chemokine signaling and cytotoxic lymphocytes and reduced survival in patients with PDAC.

Two PARP1 mutations found in individuals with breast cancer (E90K and S104R) enhanced the PARP1–USP15 interaction and suppressed PARP1 ubiquitination, thereby elevating the protein level of PARP1. Importantly, we found that estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) inhibited USP15-mediated PARP1 stabilization through different mechanisms. ER bound to the USP15 promoter to suppress its expression, PR suppressed the deubiquitinase activity of USP15, and HER2 abrogated the PARP1–USP15 interaction.

BACH1 strongly interacts with p53R175H but fails to effectively bind wild-type p53 or other hotspot mutants in vivo for functional regulation. Notably, p53R175H acts as a repressor for ferroptosis by abrogating BACH1-mediated downregulation of SLC7A11 to enhance tumor growth; conversely, p53R175H promotes BACH1-dependent tumor metastasis by upregulating expression of pro-metastatic targets. Mechanistically, p53R175H-mediated bidirectional regulation of BACH1 function is dependent on its ability to recruit the histone demethylase LSD2 to target promoters and differentially modulate transcription.

Tumor cell nuclear expulsion results in an extracellular DNA–protein complex that is enriched with receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) ligands. The chromatin-bound RAGE ligand S100a4 activates RAGE receptors in neighboring surviving tumor cells, leading to Erk activation.

In young mice, low-level Pdgfc expression by ER+ DTCs is required for their maintenance in secondary sites but is insufficient to support development of macrometastases. By contrast, the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-Chi environment of aging or fibrotic lungs promotes DTC proliferation and upregulates tumor cell Pdgfc expression stimulating further stromal activation, events that can be blocked by pharmacological inhibition of PDGFRα or with a PDGF-C-blocking antibody.

Multivalency from both the specific and promiscuous interactions between IRF1 and KAT8 is required for condensate formation. KAT8–IRF1 condensation promotes IRF1 K78 acetylation and binding to the CD247 (PD-L1) promoter and further enriches the transcription apparatus to promote transcription of PD-L1 mRNA.

We find that the lung and liver are lipid-rich environments. Moreover, we observe that pre-metastatic niche formation increases palmitate availability only in the lung, whereas a high-fat diet increases it in both organs. In line with this, targeting palmitate processing inhibits breast cancer-derived lung metastasis formation. Mechanistically, breast cancer cells use palmitate to synthesize acetyl-CoA in a carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a-dependent manner. Concomitantly, lysine acetyltransferase 2a expression is promoted by palmitate, linking the available acetyl-CoA to the acetylation of the nuclear factor-kappaB subunit p65. Deletion of lysine acetyltransferase 2a or carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a reduces metastasis formation in lean and high-fat diet mice, and lung and liver metastases from patients with breast cancer show coexpression of both proteins. In conclusion, palmitate-rich environments foster metastases growth by increasing p65 acetylation, resulting in a pro-metastatic nuclear factor-kappaB signaling.","2023-03","2024-06-11 00:52:23","2024-06-11 00:52:23","2024-05-27 00:51:18","344-364","","3","4","","Nat Cancer","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/CGK3B9JX/Altea-Manzano et al. - 2023 - A palmitate-rich metastatic niche enables metastas.pdf","","Zero","Cancer; Cancer metabolism; Breast cancer; Metastasis; Fatty acids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In subtype-matched patient-derived models, we validated PKCδ and DNA-PK as master kinases of glycolytic/plurimetabolic and proliferative/progenitor subtypes, respectively, and qualified the kinases as potent and actionable glioblastoma subtype-specific therapeutic targets. Glioblastoma subtypes were associated with clinical and radiomics features, orthogonally validated by proteomics, phospho-proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics and acetylomics analyses, and recapitulated in pediatric glioma, breast and lung squamous cell carcinoma, including subtype specificity of PKCδ and DNA-PK activity.

We identified only a small number of mutational signatures active in pediatric cancers, compared with previously analyzed adult cancers. Further, we report a significant difference in the proportion of pediatric tumors showing homologous recombination repair defect signatures compared with previous analyses. In pediatric leukemias, we identified an indel signature, not previously reported, characterized by long insertions in nonrepeat regions, affecting mainly intronic and intergenic regions, but also exons of known cancer genes. We provide a systematic overview of COSMIC v.3 mutational signatures active across pediatric cancers, which is highly relevant for understanding tumor biology and enabling future research in defining biomarkers of treatment response.","2023-02","2024-06-11 00:52:23","2024-06-11 00:52:23","2024-05-27 00:51:18","276-289","","2","4","","Nat Cancer","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/6FF8K6G8/Thatikonda et al. - 2023 - Comprehensive analysis of mutational signatures re.pdf","","No problem","Cancer; Cancer genomics; Paediatric cancer; Functional clustering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to ineffective patient stratification, efficacy is impaired by paucity of intratumoral immune cells (itICs); thus, effective strategies to safely increase itICs are needed. We report that dietary administration of l-fucose induces fucosylation and cell surface enrichment of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II protein HLA-DRB1 in melanoma cells, triggering CD4+ T cell-mediated increases in itICs and anti-tumor immunity, enhancing immune checkpoint blockade responses. Melanoma fucosylation and fucosylated HLA-DRB1 associate with intratumoral T cell abundance and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) responder status in patient melanoma specimens, suggesting the potential use of melanoma fucosylation as a strategy for stratifying patients for immunotherapies. Our findings demonstrate that fucosylation is a key mediator of anti-tumor immunity and, importantly, suggest that l-fucose is a powerful agent for safely increasing itICs and immunotherapy efficacy in melanoma.","2023-02","2024-06-11 00:52:23","2024-06-11 00:52:23","2024-05-27 00:51:18","222-239","","2","4","","Nat Cancer","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/Q83SCUJP/Lester et al. - 2023 - Fucosylation of HLA-DRB1 regulates CD4+ T cell-med.pdf","","No problem","Tumour immunology; Cancer; Cancer immunotherapy; Melanoma; Dietary carbohydrates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How cancer cells retain effects of prolonged IFN stimulation to coordinate resistance is unclear. We show that, across human and/or mouse tumors, immune dysfunction is associated with cancer cells acquiring epigenetic features of inflammatory memory. Here, inflammatory memory domains, many of which are initiated by chronic IFN-γ, are maintained by signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 and IFN regulatory factor (IRF)3 and link histone 3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1)-marked chromatin accessibility to increased expression of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs include the RNA sensor OAS1 that amplifies type I IFN (IFN-I) and immune inhibitory genes. Abrogating cancer cell IFN-I signaling restores anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) response by increasing IFN-γ in immune cells, promoting dendritic cell and CD8+ T cell interactions, and expanding T cells toward effector-like states rather than exhausted states. Thus, cancer cells acquire inflammatory memory to augment a subset of ISGs that promote and predict IFN-driven immune dysfunction.","2023-01","2024-06-11 00:52:23","2024-06-11 00:52:23","2024-05-27 00:51:18","43-61","","1","4","","Nat Cancer","","","","","","","","en","2022 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","","","","www.nature.com","","Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/HJZN4MZ9/Qiu et al. - 2023 - Cancer cells resistant to immune checkpoint blocka.pdf","","No problem","Tumour immunology; Cancer; Cancer immunotherapy; Immune evasion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
