We identified a proteomic signature that differentiated TREM2 variant carriers from both individuals with sporadic AD and healthy individuals. The proteins associated with sporadic AD were also altered in patients with ADAD, but with a greater effect size. Brain-derived proteins associated with ADAD were also replicated in additional CSF samples. Enrichment analyses highlighted several pathways, including those implicated in AD (calcineurin and Apo E), Parkinson’s disease (α-synuclein and LRRK2), and innate immune responses (SHC1, ERK-1, and SPP1).

Here, we used a large-scale proteomics platform to examine the association of 4877 plasma proteins with 25-year dementia risk in 10,981 middle-aged adults. We found 32 dementia-associated plasma proteins that were involved in proteostasis, immunity, synaptic function, and extracellular matrix organization. We then replicated the association between 15 of these proteins and clinically relevant neurocognitive outcomes in two independent cohorts. We demonstrated that 12 of these 32 dementia-associated proteins were associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD, neurodegeneration, or neuroinflammation. We found that eight of these candidate protein markers were abnormally expressed in human postmortem brain tissue from patients with AD, although some of the proteins that were most strongly associated with dementia risk, such as GDF15, were not detected in these brain tissue samples. Using network analyses, we found a protein signature for dementia risk that was characterized by dysregulation of specific immune and proteostasis/autophagy pathways in adults in midlife ~20 years before dementia onset, as well as abnormal coagulation and complement signaling ~10 years before dementia onset. Bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization genetically validated nine of our candidate proteins as markers of AD in midlife and inferred causality of SERPINA3 in AD pathogenesis.

Here, we show that after Achilles tendon injury in mice, there is new nerve growth near tendon cells that express nerve growth factor (NGF). Conditional deletion of the Ngf gene in either myeloid or mesenchymal mouse cells limited both innervation and tendon repair. Similarly, inhibition of the NGF receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) abrogated tendon healing in mouse tendon injury. Sural nerve transection blocked the postinjury increase in tendon sensory innervation and the expansion of tendon sheath progenitor cells (TSPCs) expressing tubulin polymerization promoting protein family member 3. Single cell and spatial transcriptomics revealed that disruption of sensory innervation resulted in dysregulated inflammatory signaling and transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling in injured mouse tendon. Culture of mouse TSPCs with conditioned medium from dorsal root ganglia neuron further supported a role for neuronal mediators and TGFβ signaling in TSPC proliferation. Transcriptomic and histologic analyses of injured human tendon biopsy samples supported a role for innervation and TGFβ signaling in human tendon regeneration. Last, treating mice after tendon injury systemically with a small-molecule partial agonist of TrkA increased neurovascular response, TGFβ signaling, TSPC expansion, and tendon tissue repair.

Inflammatory cytokines mediate damage to key GVHD targets such as intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and also activate receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1; RIPK1), a critical regulator of apoptosis and necroptosis. We therefore investigated the role of RIP1 in acute GVHD using samples from HCT patients, modeling GVHD damage in vitro with both human and mouse gastrointestinal (GI) organoids, and blocking RIP1 activation in vivo using several well-characterized mouse HCT models. Increased phospho-RIP1 expression in GI biopsies from patients with acute GVHD correlated with tissue damage and predicted NRM. Both the genetic inactivation of RIP1 and the RIP1 inhibitor GNE684 prevented GVHD-induced apoptosis of ISCs in vivo and in vitro. Daily administration of GNE684 for 14 days reduced inflammatory infiltrates in three GVHD target organs (intestine, liver, and spleen) in mice. Unexpectedly, GNE684 administration also reversed the marked loss of regulatory T cells in the intestines and liver during GVHD and reduced splenic T cell exhaustion, thus improving immune reconstitution. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of RIP1 improved long-term survival without compromising the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect in lymphocytic and myeloid leukemia mouse models.

Here, we investigated how FOXP3 deficiency affects the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and Treg stability in vivo and compared T cell abnormalities in patients with IPEX with those in patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy syndrome (APECED). To study Tregs independently of their phenotype and to analyze T cell autoreactivity, we combined Treg-specific demethylation region analyses, single-cell multiomic profiling, and bulk TCR sequencing. We found that patients with IPEX, unlike patients with APECED, have expanded autoreactive T cells originating from both autoreactive effector T cells (Teffs) and Tregs. In addition, a fraction of the expanded Tregs from patients with IPEX lost their phenotypic and functional markers, including CD25 and FOXP3. Functional experiments with CRISPR-Cas9–mediated FOXP3 knockout Tregs and Tregs from patients with IPEX indicated that the patients’ Tregs gain a TH2-skewed Teff-like function, which is consistent with immune dysregulation observed in these patients. Analyses of FOXP3 mutation-carrier mothers and a patient with IPEX after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation indicated that Tregs expressing nonmutated FOXP3 prevent the accumulation of autoreactive Teffs and unstable Tregs. These findings could be directly used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes and for monitoring the effects of immunomodulatory treatments.","2023-12-20","2024-05-26 07:00:13","2024-05-26 07:15:29","2024-05-26 07:00:13","eadg6822","","727","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/CUZWIWEM/Borna et al. - 2023 - Identification of unstable regulatory and autoreac.pdf","","Log; Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we demonstrated systemic wasting that also affected innervated nonparalyzed (supralesional) muscles and emerged within 1 week after experimental SCI in mice. Systemic muscle wasting caused muscle weakness, affected fast type 2 myofibers preferentially, and became exacerbated after high (T3) compared with low (T9) thoracic paraplegia, indicating lesion level–dependent (“neurogenic”) mechanisms. The wasting of nonparalyzed muscle and its rapid onset and severity beyond what can be explained by disuse implied unknown systemic drivers. Muscle transcriptome and biochemical analysis revealed a glucocorticoid-mediated catabolic signature early after T3 SCI. SCI-induced systemic muscle wasting was mitigated by (i) endogenous glucocorticoid ablation (adrenalectomy) and (ii) pharmacological glucocorticoid receptor (GR) blockade and was (iii) completely prevented after T3 relative to T9 SCI by genetic muscle-specific GR deletion.

Our previous study established a role for wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1WT) as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but how IDH1WT modulates NSCLC progression remains elusive. Here, we report that IDH1WT activates serine biosynthesis by enhancing the expression of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1), the first and second enzymes of de novo serine synthetic pathway. Augmented serine synthesis leads to GSH/ROS imbalance and supports pyrimidine biosynthesis, maintaining tumor initiation capacity and enhancing gemcitabine chemoresistance. Mechanistically, we identify that IDH1WT interacts with and stabilizes PHGDH and fragile X–related protein-1 (FXR1) by impeding their association with the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin by coimmunoprecipitation assay and proximity ligation assay. Subsequently, stabilized FXR1 supports PSAT1 mRNA stability and translation, as determined by actinomycin D chase experiment and in vitro translation assay. Disrupting IDH1WT-PHGDH and IDH1WT-FXR1 interactions synergistically reduces NSCLC stemness and sensitizes NSCLC cells to gemcitabine and serine/glycine–depleted diet therapy in lung cancer xenograft models. Collectively, our findings offer insights into the role of IDH1WT in serine metabolism, highlighting IDH1WT as a potential therapeutic target for eradicating TICs and overcoming gemcitabine chemoresistance in NSCLC.","2023-12-13","2024-05-26 07:00:17","2024-05-26 07:16:31","2024-05-26 07:00:17","eade4113","","726","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/CRIDTZCY/Zhang et al. - 2023 - Wild-type IDH1 maintains NSCLC stemness and chemor.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In mouse models of AKI, maladaptive repair of the injured proximal tubule (PT) prevents complete tissue recovery. However, evidence for PT maladaptation and its etiological relationship with complications of AKI is lacking in humans. We performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing of 120,985 nuclei in kidneys from 17 participants with AKI and seven healthy controls from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project. Maladaptive PT cells, which exhibited transcriptomic features of dedifferentiation and enrichment in pro-inflammatory and profibrotic pathways, were present in participants with AKI of diverse etiologies. To develop plasma markers of PT maladaptation, we analyzed the plasma proteome in two independent cohorts of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and a cohort of marathon runners, linked it to the transcriptomic signatures associated with maladaptive PT, and identified nine proteins whose genes were specifically up- or down-regulated by maladaptive PT. After cardiac surgery, both cohorts of patients had increased transforming growth factor–β2 (TGFB2), collagen type XXIII-α1 (COL23A1), and X-linked neuroligin 4 (NLGN4X) and had decreased plasminogen (PLG), ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 6 (ENPP6), and protein C (PROC). Similar changes were observed in marathon runners with exercise-associated kidney injury. Postoperative changes in these markers were associated with AKI progression in adults after cardiac surgery and post-AKI kidney atrophy in mouse models of ischemia-reperfusion injury and toxic injury.

Although eliminating pathogenic IgE may be a powerful way to treat allergy, no therapeutic strategy reported to date can fully ablate IgE production. Interleukin-4 receptor α (IL-4Rα) signaling is required for IgE class switching, and IL-4Rα blockade gradually reduces, but does not eliminate, IgE. The persistence of IgE after IL-4Rα blockade may be due to long-lived IgE+ plasma cells that maintain serological memory to allergens and thus may be susceptible to plasma cell–targeted therapeutics. We demonstrate that transient administration of a B cell maturation antigen x CD3 (BCMAxCD3) bispecific antibody markedly depletes IgE, as well as other immunoglobulins, by ablating long-lived plasma cells, although IgE and other immunoglobulins rapidly rebound after treatment. Concomitant IL-4Rα blockade specifically and durably prevents the reemergence of IgE by blocking IgE class switching while allowing the restoration of other immunoglobulins. Moreover, this combination treatment prevented anaphylaxis in mice. Together with additional cynomolgus monkey and human data, our studies demonstrate that allergic memory is primarily maintained by both non-IgE+ memory B cells that require class switching and long-lived IgE+ plasma cells. Our combination approach to durably eliminate pathogenic IgE has potential to benefit allergy in humans while preserving antibody-mediated immunity.","2023-12-13","2024-05-26 07:00:20","2024-05-26 07:17:43","2024-05-26 07:00:20","eadf9561","","726","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/FAFAZKHN/Limnander et al. - 2023 - A therapeutic strategy to target distinct sources .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Better treatment options are therefore urgently required. Here, we describe a pyrrolopyrimidine series, identified through phenotypic screening, that offers an opportunity to improve on current treatments. In vitro cell-based washout assays demonstrate that compounds in the series are incapable of killing all parasites; however, combining these pyrrolopyrimidines with a subefficacious dose of BNZ can clear all parasites in vitro after 5 days. These findings were replicated in a clinically predictive in vivo model of chronic Chagas disease, where 5 days of treatment with the combination was sufficient to prevent parasite relapse. Comprehensive mechanism of action studies, supported by ligand-structure modeling, show that compounds from this pyrrolopyrimidine series inhibit the Qi active site of T. cruzi cytochrome b, part of the cytochrome bc1 complex of the electron transport chain. Knowledge of the molecular target enabled a cascade of assays to be assembled to evaluate selectivity over the human cytochrome b homolog. As a result, a highly selective and efficacious lead compound was identified. The combination of our lead compound with BNZ rapidly clears T. cruzi parasites, both in vitro and in vivo, and shows great potential to overcome key issues associated with currently available treatments.","2023-12-13","2024-05-26 07:00:22","2024-05-26 07:17:59","2024-05-26 07:00:21","eadg8105","","726","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/N9M57RZ2/González et al. - 2023 - Short-course combination treatment for experimenta.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, barcoded simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), SIVmac239M, was used to infect rhesus macaques to enable monitoring of viral barcode clonotypes contributing to virus detectable in plasma after ATI. Blood and tissues from secondary lymphoid organs (spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and inguinal lymph nodes) and from the colon, ileum, lung, liver, and brain were analyzed using viral barcode sequencing, intact proviral DNA assay, single-cell RNA sequencing, and combined CODEX and RNAscope in situ hybridization. Four of seven animals had viral barcodes detectable by deep sequencing of plasma at necropsy, although plasma viral RNA remained below 22 copies per milliliter. Among the tissues studied, mesenteric lymph nodes, inguinal lymph nodes, and spleen contained viral barcodes detected in plasma. CD4+ T cells were the main cell type harboring viral RNA after ATI.

We investigated primary bronchoalveolar lavage cells from current and never smokers by performing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), flow cytometry, and functional assays. We observed the enrichment of immature inflammatory monocytes in the lungs of smokers compared with nonsmokers. These monocytes exhibited phenotypes consistent with recent recruitment from blood, ongoing differentiation, increased activation, and states similar to those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Using integrative scRNA-seq and flow cytometry, we identified CD93 as a marker for a subset of these newly recruited smoking-associated lung monocytes and further provided evidence that the recruitment of monocytes into the lung was mediated by CCR2-binding chemokines, including CCL11. We also show that these cells exhibit elevated inflammatory responses upon exposure to Mtb and accelerated intracellular growth of Mtb compared with mature macrophages. This elevated Mtb growth could be inhibited by anti-inflammatory small molecules, providing a connection between smoking-induced pro-inflammatory states and permissiveness to Mtb growth. Our findings suggest a model in which smoking leads to the recruitment of immature inflammatory monocytes from the periphery to the lung, which results in the accumulation of these Mtb-permissive cells in the airway.

In this work, we coupled ex vivo cytokine and drug perturbations of human precision-cut lung slices (hPCLS) with single-cell RNA sequencing and induced a multilineage circuit of fibrogenic cell states in hPCLS. We showed that these cell states were highly similar to the in vivo cell circuit in a multicohort lung cell atlas from patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Using micro-CT–staged patient tissues, we characterized the appearance and interaction of myofibroblasts, an ectopic endothelial cell state, and basaloid epithelial cells in the thickened alveolar septum of early-stage lung fibrosis. Induction of these states in the hPCLS model provided evidence that the basaloid cell state was derived from alveolar type 2 cells, whereas the ectopic endothelial cell state emerged from capillary cell plasticity. Cell-cell communication routes in patients were largely conserved in hPCLS, and antifibrotic drug treatments showed highly cell type–specific effects.

In the work presented here, we investigated a retrospective and multicentric cohort of 250 archival Papanicolaou (Pap) test smears collected during routine gynecological screening. Samples were taken at different time points (from 1 month to 13.5 years before diagnosis) from 113 presymptomatic women who were subsequently diagnosed with HGSOC (pre-HGSOC) and from 77 healthy women. Genome instability was detected through low-pass whole-genome sequencing of DNA derived from Pap test samples in terms of copy number profile abnormality (CPA). CPA values of DNA extracted from Pap test samples from pre-HGSOC women were substantially higher than those in samples from healthy women. Consistently with the longitudinal analysis of clonal pathogenic TP53 mutations, this assay could detect HGSOC presence up to 9 years before diagnosis. This finding confirms the continual shedding of tumor cells from fimbriae toward the endocervical canal, suggesting a new path for the early diagnosis of HGSOC. We integrated the CPA score into the EVA (early ovarian cancer) test, the sensitivity of which was 75% (95% CI, 64.97 to 85.79), the specificity 96% (95% CI, 88.35 to 100.00), and the accuracy 81%.

In this study, we describe the molecular determinant of VVC immunopathology and a potentially straightforward way to prevent disease. In response to zinc limitation, C. albicans releases a trace mineral binding molecule called Pra1 (pH-regulated antigen). Here, we show that the PRA1 gene is strongly up-regulated during vaginal infections and that its expression positively correlated with proinflammatory cytokine concentrations in women. Genetic deletion of PRA1 prevented vaginal inflammation in mice, and application of a zinc solution down-regulated expression of the gene and also blocked immunopathology. We also show that treatment of women suffering from recurrent VVC with a zinc gel prevented reinfections.

However, there are currently no effective treatments for radiation-induced bone loss, and the consequences of radiotherapy on skeletal progenitor cell (SPC) survival and function remain unclear. After radiation, leptin receptor–expressing cells, which include a population of SPCs, become localized to hypoxic regions of the bone and stabilize the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α), thus suggesting a role for HIF-2α in the skeletal response to radiation. Here, we conditionally knocked out HIF-2α in leptin receptor–expressing cells and their descendants in mice. Radiation therapy in littermate control mice reduced bone mass; however, HIF-2α conditional knockout mice maintained bone mass comparable to nonirradiated control animals. HIF-2α negatively regulated the number of SPCs, bone formation, and bone mineralization. To test whether blocking HIF-2α pharmacologically could reduce bone loss during radiation, we administered a selective HIF-2α inhibitor called PT2399 (a structural analog of which was recently FDA-approved) to wild-type mice before radiation exposure. Pharmacological inhibition of HIF-2α was sufficient to prevent radiation-induced bone loss in a single-limb irradiation mouse model. Given that ~90% of patients who receive a HIF-2α inhibitor develop anemia because of off-target effects, we developed a bone-targeting nanocarrier formulation to deliver the HIF-2α inhibitor to mouse bone, to increase on-target efficacy and reduce off-target toxicities. Nanocarrier-loaded PT2399 prevented radiation-induced bone loss in mice while reducing drug accumulation in the kidney.

Here, we elucidate key characteristics of the “normal” vaginal epithelial glycan landscape and analyze the impact of resident microbes on the surface glycocalyx. In human BV, glycocalyx staining was visibly diminished in electron micrographs compared to controls. Biochemical and mass spectrometric analysis showed that, compared to normal vaginal epithelial cells, BV cells were depleted of sialylated N- and O-glycans, with underlying galactose residues exposed on the surface. Treatment of primary epithelial cells from BV-negative women with recombinant Gardnerella sialidases generated BV-like glycan phenotypes. Exposure of cultured VK2 vaginal epithelial cells to recombinant Gardnerella sialidase led to desialylation of glycans and induction of pathways regulating cell death, differentiation, and inflammatory responses.

Complementary proteomic approaches in cellular and animal models of PD were used to identify and characterize the pathologic α-synuclein interactome. We report that the highest biological processes that interacted with pathologic α-synuclein in mice included RNA processing and translation initiation. Regulation of catabolic processes that include autophagy were also identified. Pathologic α-synuclein was found to bind with the tuberous sclerosis protein 2 (TSC2) and to trigger the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), which augmented mRNA translation and protein synthesis, leading to neurodegeneration. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR and protein synthesis rescued the dopamine neuron loss, behavioral deficits, and aberrant biochemical signaling in the α-synuclein preformed fibril mouse model and Drosophila transgenic models of pathologic α-synuclein–induced degeneration. Pathologic α-synuclein furthermore led to a destabilization of the TSC1-TSC2 complex, which plays an important role in mTORC1 activity. Constitutive overexpression of TSC2 rescued motor deficits and neuropathology in α-synuclein flies. Biochemical examination of PD postmortem brain tissues also suggested deregulated mTORC1 signaling.

Here, we evaluate the cellular immune responses after both SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in patients receiving the anti-CD20 therapy rituximab (RTX) and those with low B cell counts due to common variable immune deficiency (CVID) disease. Assessment of effector and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 revealed elevated reactivity and proliferative capacity after both infection and vaccination in B cell–deficient individuals, particularly within the CD8+ T cell compartment, in comparison with healthy controls. Evaluation of clinical outcomes demonstrates that vaccination of RTX-treated individuals was associated with about 4.8-fold reduced odds of moderate or severe COVID-19 in the absence of vaccine-induced antibodies. Analysis of T cell differentiation demonstrates that RTX administration increases the relative frequency of naïve CD8+ T cells, potentially by depletion of CD8+CD20dim T cells, which are primarily of an effector memory or terminal effector memory (TEMRA) phenotype.

Here, we describe a first-in-class bifunctional therapeutic molecule, STAR0602, that comprises an antibody targeting germline Vβ6 and Vβ10 T cell receptors (TCRs) fused to human interleukin-2 (IL-2) and simultaneously engages a nonclonal mode of TCR activation with costimulation to promote activation and expansion of αβ T cell subsets expressing distinct variable β (Vβ) TCR chains. In solution, STAR0602 binds IL-2 receptors in cis with Vβ6/Vβ10 TCRs on the same T cell, promoting expansion of human Vβ6 and Vβ10 CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that acquire an atypical central memory phenotype. Monotherapy with a mouse surrogate molecule induced durable tumor regression across six murine solid tumor models, including several refractory to anti–PD-1. Analysis of murine tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) transcriptomes revealed that expanded Vβ T cells acquired a distinct effector memory phenotype with suppression of genes associated with T cell exhaustion and TCR signaling repression. Sequencing of TIL TCRs also revealed an increased T cell repertoire diversity within targeted Vβ T cell subsets, suggesting clonal revival of tumor T cell responses. These immunological and antitumor effects in mice were recapitulated in studies of STAR0602 in nonhuman primates and human ex vivo models, wherein STAR0602 boosted human antigen-specific T cell responses and killing of tumor organoids. Thus, STAR0602 represents a distinct class of T cell–activating molecules with the potential to deliver enhanced antitumor activity in checkpoint inhibitor–refractory settings.","2023-11-29","2024-05-26 07:04:53","2024-05-26 07:24:11","2024-05-26 07:04:53","eadi0258","","724","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/W87JSU3Q/Hsu et al. - 2023 - A T cell receptor β chain–directed antibody fusion.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even before weight gain, a rapid rise in circulating leptin concentrations can be observed in most patients taking antipsychotic drugs. To date, the contribution of this hyperleptinemia to weight gain and metabolic deterioration has not been defined. Here, with an established mouse model that recapitulates antipsychotic drug–induced obesity and insulin resistance, we not only confirm that hyperleptinemia occurs before weight gain but also demonstrate that hyperleptinemia contributes directly to the development of obesity and associated metabolic disorders. By suppressing the rise in leptin through the use of a monoclonal leptin-neutralizing antibody, we effectively prevented weight gain, restored glucose tolerance, and preserved adipose tissue and liver function in antipsychotic drug–treated mice. Mechanistically, suppressing excess leptin resolved local tissue and systemic inflammation typically associated with antipsychotic drug treatment.

The lack of repair and the acute inflammation that arise after injury can further compromise the disc and result in disc-wide degeneration in the long term. To address this clinical need, we developed tension-activated repair patches (TARPs) for annulus fibrosus repair and local delivery of the anti-inflammatory factor anakinra (a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist). TARPs transmit physiologic strain to mechanically activated microcapsules embedded within the patch, which release encapsulated bioactive molecules in direct response to spinal loading. Mechanically activated microcapsules carrying anakinra were loaded into TARPs, and the effects of TARP-mediated annular repair and anakinra delivery were evaluated in a goat model of annular injury in the cervical spine. TARPs integrated with native tissue and provided structural reinforcement at the injury site that prevented aberrant disc-wide remodeling resulting from detensioning of the annular fibrosus. The delivery of anakinra by TARP implantation increased matrix deposition and retention at the injury site and improved maintenance of disc extracellular matrix. Anakinra delivery additionally attenuated the inflammatory response associated with TARP implantation, decreasing osteolysis in adjacent vertebrae and preserving disc cellularity and matrix organization throughout the annulus fibrosus.

DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are highly expressed, and global DNA methylation is dysregulated in NEPC. We identified that deletion of DNMT genes decreases expression of neuroendocrine lineage markers and substantially reduced NEPC tumor development and metastasis in vivo. Decitabine, a pan-DNMT inhibitor, attenuated tumor growth in NEPC patient–derived xenograft models, as well as retinoblastoma gene (RB1)–deficient castration-resistant prostate adenocarcinoma (CRPC) models compared with RB1-proficient CRPC. We further found that DNMT inhibition increased expression of B7 homolog 3 (B7-H3), an emerging druggable target, via demethylation of B7-H3. We tested DS-7300a (i-DXd), an antibody-drug conjugate targeting B7-H3, alone and in combination with decitabine in models of advanced prostate cancer. There was potent single-agent antitumor activity of DS-7300a in both CRPC and NEPC bearing high expression of B7-H3. In B7-H3–low models, combination therapy of decitabine plus DS-7300a resulted in enhanced response. DNMT inhibition may therefore be a promising therapeutic target for NEPC and RB1-deficient CRPC and may sensitize B7-H3–low prostate cancer to DS-7300a through increasing target expression. NEPC and RB1-deficient CRPC represent prostate cancer subgroups with poor prognosis, and the development of biomarker-driven therapeutic strategies for these populations may ultimately help improve patient outcomes.","2023-11-15","2024-05-26 07:05:25","2024-05-26 07:26:55","2024-05-26 07:05:25","eadf6732","","722","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/PFFC8AB3/Yamada et al. - 2023 - Targeting DNA methylation and B7-H3 in RB1-deficie.pdf","","Log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ML-T7 enhanced the survival and antitumor activity of primary CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and human chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and reduced their exhaustion in vitro and in vivo. In addition, ML-T7 promoted NK cells’ killing activity and DC antigen-presenting capacity, consistent with the reported activity of Tim-3. ML-T7 strengthened DCs’ functions through both Tim-3 and Tim-4, which is consistent with the fact that Tim-4 contains a similar FG-CC′ loop. Intraperitoneal dosing of ML-T7 showed comparable tumor inhibitory effects to the Tim-3 blocking antibody. ML-T7 reduced syngeneic tumor progression in both wild-type and Tim-3 humanized mice and alleviated the immunosuppressive microenvironment.

During aging and spinal degeneration, the balance between the normal endplate (EP) bilayers of cartilage and bone shifts to more bone. The aged/degenerated bony EP has increased porosity because of osteoclastic remodeling activity and may be a source of LBP due to aberrant sensory innervation within the pores. We used two mouse models of spinal degeneration to show that parathyroid hormone (PTH) treatment induced osteogenesis and angiogenesis and reduced the porosity of bony EPs. PTH increased the cartilaginous volume and improved the mechanical properties of EPs, which was accompanied by a reduction of the inflammatory factors cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandin E2. PTH treatment furthermore partially reversed the innervation of porous EPs and reversed LBP-related behaviors. Conditional knockout of PTH 1 receptors in the nucleus pulposus (NP) did not abolish the treatment effects of PTH, suggesting that the NP is not the primary source of LBP in our mouse models. Last, we showed that aged rhesus macaques with spontaneous spinal degeneration also had decreased EP porosity and sensory innervation when treated with PTH, demonstrating a similar mechanism of PTH action on EP sclerosis between mice and macaques. In summary, our results suggest that PTH treatment could partially reverse EP restructuring during spinal regeneration and support further investigation into this potentially disease-modifying treatment strategy for LBP.","2023-11-15","2024-05-26 07:05:28","2024-05-26 07:29:22","2024-05-26 07:05:28","eadg8982","","722","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/HLYJL847/Ling et al. - 2023 - Parathyroid hormone treatment partially reverses e.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Periodic epidemics under this scenario can only be sustained with a constant influx of infected individuals into the population or a high basic reproductive number.

Patients develop a life-threatening renal proximal tubule dysfunction for which no treatment is available apart from electrolyte replacement. To investigate the renal pathogenesis of FBS, SLC2A2 expression was ablated in mouse kidney and HK-2 proximal tubule cells. GLUT2Pax8Cre+ mice developed time-dependent glycogen accumulation in proximal tubule cells and recapitulated the renal Fanconi phenotype seen in patients. In vitro suppression of GLUT2 impaired lysosomal autophagy as shown by transcriptomic and biochemical analysis.

To investigate whether targeting proximal tubule glucose influx can limit glycogen accumulation and correct symptoms in vivo, we treated mice with the selective SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin reduced glycogen accumulation and improved metabolic acidosis and phosphaturia in the animals by normalizing the expression of Napi2a and NHE3 transporters.

We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of FMT for MDRO decolonization in renal transplant recipients called PREMIX (NCT02922816). Eleven participants were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to FMT or an observation period followed by delayed FMT if stool cultures were MDRO positive at day 36. Participants who were MDRO positive after one FMT were treated with a second FMT. At last visit, eight of nine patients who completed all treatments were MDRO culture negative. FMT-treated participants had longer time to recurrent MDRO infection versus PREMIX-eligible controls who were not treated with FMT. Key taxa (Akkermansia muciniphila, Alistipes putredinis, Phocaeicola dorei, Phascolarctobacterium faecium, Alistipes species, Mesosutterella massiliensis, Barnesiella intestinihominis, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) from the single feces donor used in the study that engrafted in recipients and metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids and bile acids in FMT-responding participants uncovered leads for rational microbiome therapeutic and diagnostic development. Metagenomic analyses revealed a previously unobserved mechanism of MDRO eradication by conspecific strain competition in an FMT-treated subset. Susceptible Enterobacterales strains that replaced baseline extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing strains were not detectable in donor microbiota manufactured as FMT doses but in one case were detectable in the recipient before FMT. These data suggest that FMT may provide a path to exploit strain competition to reduce MDRO colonization.","2023-11","2024-05-26 07:05:36","2024-05-26 07:29:52","2024-05-26 07:05:36","eabo2750","","720","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/LKWVDX27/Woodworth et al. - 2023 - Fecal microbiota transplantation promotes reductio.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The atheroprotective functions of CXCR4 in vascular cells may be counteracted by atherogenic functions in other nonvascular cell types. Thus, strategies for cell-specifically augmenting CXCR4 function in vascular cells are crucial if this receptor is to be useful as a therapeutic target in treating atherosclerosis and other vascular disorders. Here, we identified miR-206-3p as a vascular-specific CXCR4 repressor and exploited a target-site blocker (CXCR4-TSB) that disrupted the interaction of miR-206-3p with CXCR4 in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, CXCR4-TSB enhanced CXCR4 expression in human and murine ECs and VSMCs to modulate cell viability, proliferation, and migration. Systemic administration of CXCR4-TSB in Apoe-deficient mice enhanced Cxcr4 expression in ECs and VSMCs in the walls of blood vessels, reduced vascular permeability and monocyte adhesion to endothelium, and attenuated the development of diet-induced atherosclerosis. CXCR4-TSB also increased CXCR4 expression in B cells, corroborating its atheroprotective role in this cell type. Analyses of human atherosclerotic plaque specimens revealed a decrease in CXCR4 and an increase in miR-206-3p expression in advanced compared with early lesions, supporting a role for the miR-206-3p–CXCR4 interaction in human disease. Disrupting the miR-206-3p–CXCR4 interaction in a cell-specific manner with target-site blockers is a potential therapeutic approach that could be used to treat atherosclerosis and other vascular diseases.","2023-11","2024-05-26 07:05:37","2024-05-26 07:31:47","2024-05-26 07:05:37","eadf3357","","720","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/JXEQ6VM3/Cimen et al. - 2023 - Targeting a cell-specific microRNA repressor of CX.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we used In-Cell Western assays combined with an unbiased drug screening to identify the compound N6F11 as a ferroptosis inducer that triggered the degradation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key ferroptosis repressor, specifically in cancer cells. N6F11 did not cause the degradation of GPX4 in immune cells, including dendritic, T, natural killer, and neutrophil cells. Mechanistically, N6F11 bound to the RING domain of E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25) in cancer cells to trigger TRIM25-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination of GPX4, resulting in its proteasomal degradation. Functionally, N6F11 treatment caused ferroptotic cancer cell death that initiated HMGB1-dependent antitumor immunity mediated by CD8+ T cells. N6F11 also sensitized immune checkpoint blockade that targeted CD274/PD-L1 in advanced cancer models, including genetically engineered mouse models of pancreatic cancer driven by KRAS and TP53 mutations.

However, high rates of CSF turnover prevent adequate drug accumulation and lead to rapid systemic clearance and toxicity. Here, we show that PLA-HPG nanoparticles, made with a single-emulsion, solvent evaporation process, can encapsulate talazoparib, a PARP inhibitor (BMN-673). These degradable polymer nanoparticles improve the therapeutic index when delivered intrathecally and lead to sustained drug retention in the tumor as measured with PET imaging and fluorescence microscopy. We demonstrate that administration of these particles into the CSF, alone or in combination with systemically administered temozolomide, is a highly effective therapy for tumor regression and prevention of leptomeningeal spread in xenograft mouse models of medulloblastoma.

Given the antigenic similarity between ZIKV and the closely related virus dengue (DENV) and the potential of DENV-specific antibodies to enhance ZIKV disease severity in mice, we questioned whether maternal DENV immunity could influence fetal outcomes in a nonhuman primate model of ZIKV vertical transmission. We found significantly increased severity of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) in fetuses of DENV-immune cynomolgus macaques infected with ZIKV in early pregnancy compared with naïve controls, which occurred despite no effect on maternal ZIKV infection or antibody responses. Ultrasound measurements of head circumference and biparietal diameter measurements taken sequentially throughout pregnancy demonstrated CZS in fetuses of DENV-immune pregnant macaques. Furthermore, severe CZS enhanced by DENV immunity was typified by reduced cortical thickness and increased frequency of neuronal death, hemorrhaging, cellular infiltrations, calcifications, and lissencephaly in fetal brains. This study shows that maternal immunity to DENV can worsen ZIKV neurological outcomes in fetal primates, and it provides an animal model of vertical transmission closely approximating human developmental timelines that could be used to investigate severe ZIKV disease outcomes and interventions in fetuses.","2023-10-25","2024-05-26 07:05:43","2024-05-26 07:32:53","2024-05-26 07:05:43","eadd2420","","719","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/VVAR2DKL/Saron et al. - 2023 - Exacerbated Zika virus–induced neuropathology and .pdf","","Log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We demonstrated that a risk variant for Crohn’s disease, hepatocyte growth factor activator (HGFAC) Arg509His (R509H), disrupted a damage-sensing pathway connecting the coagulation cascade to growth factors that drive the differentiation of wound-associated epithelial (WAE) cells and production of a localized retinoic acid (RA) gradient to promote fibroblast-mediated tissue remodeling. Specifically, we showed that HGFAC R509H was activated by thrombin protease activity but exhibited impaired proteolytic activation of the growth factor macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP). In Hgfac R509H mice, reduced MSP activation in response to wounding of the colon resulted in impaired WAE cell induction and delayed healing. Through integration of single-cell transcriptomics and spatial transcriptomics, we demonstrated that WAE cells generated RA in a spatially restricted region of the wound site and that mucosal fibroblasts responded to this signal by producing extracellular matrix and growth factors. We further dissected this WAE cell–fibroblast signaling circuit in vitro using a genetically tractable organoid coculture model.

We then tracked their health across gestation and characterized infant development across the first month of life. ZIKV-infected pregnant mothers had long periods of viremia and mild changes to their hematological profiles. ZIKV RNA concentrations, an indicator of infection magnitude, were higher in mothers whose fetuses were male, and the magnitude of ZIKV RNA in the mothers’ plasma or amniotic fluid predicted infant outcomes. The magnitude of ZIKV RNA was negatively associated with infant growth across the first month of life, affecting males’ growth more than females’ growth, although for most metrics, both males and females evidenced slower growth rates as compared with control animals whose mothers were not ZIKV inoculated.

However, heterogeneity in therapeutic responses in TN-10 and other immunotherapy trials identifies gaps in understanding disease progression and treatment responses. The intestinal microbiome is a potential source of biomarkers associated with future T1D diagnosis and responses to immunotherapy. We previously reported that antibody responses to gut commensal bacteria were associated with T1D diagnosis, suggesting that certain antimicrobial immune responses may help predict disease onset. Here, we investigated anticommensal antibody (ACAb) responses against a panel of taxonomically diverse intestinal bacteria species in sera from TN-10 participants before and after teplizumab or placebo treatment. We identified IgG2 responses to three species that were associated with time to T1D diagnosis and with teplizumab treatment responses that delayed disease onset. These antibody responses link human intestinal bacteria with T1D progression, adding predictive value to known T1D risk factors.

Thus, next-generation strategies are needed to expand the depth and breadth of clinical responses. Toward this end, we designed a human primary T cell phenotypic high-throughput screening strategy to identify small molecules with distinct and complementary mechanisms of action to PD-1 checkpoint blockade. Through these efforts, we selected and optimized a chemical series that showed robust potentiation of T cell activation and combinatorial activity with αPD-1 blockade. Target identification was facilitated by chemical proteomic profiling with a lipid-based photoaffinity probe, which displayed enhanced binding to diacylglycerol kinase α (DGKα) in the presence of the active compound, a phenomenon that correlated with the translocation of DGKα to the plasma membrane. We further found that optimized leads within this chemical series were potent and selective inhibitors of both DGKα and DGKζ, lipid kinases that constitute an intracellular T cell checkpoint that blunts T cell signaling through diacylglycerol metabolism. We show that dual DGKα/ζ inhibition amplified suboptimal T cell receptor signaling mediated by low-affinity antigen presentation and low major histocompatibility complex class I expression on tumor cells, both hallmarks of resistance to PD-1 blockade. In addition, DGKα/ζ inhibitors combined with αPD-1 therapy to elicit robust tumor regression in syngeneic mouse tumor models.

We report herein a nanocapsule enzyme therapeutic based on lactate oxidase, which reduces lactate concentrations and releases immunostimulatory hydrogen peroxide, averting tumor immunosuppression and improving the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade treatment. As demonstrated in a murine melanoma model and a humanized mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer, this enzyme therapeutic affords an effective tool toward more effective cancer immunotherapy.","2023-10-11","2024-05-26 07:06:22","2024-05-26 07:36:32","2024-05-26 07:06:22","eadd2712","","717","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ZDJ6IQC8/Cao et al. - 2023 - Lactate oxidase nanocapsules boost T cell immunity.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although cSCC contributes to substantial morbidity and mortality in high-risk individuals, deployment of otherwise effective chemoprevention of cSCC is limited by toxicities. Our systematic computational drug repurposing screen predicted that selumetinib, a MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) kinase inhibitor (MEKi), would reverse transcriptional signatures associated with cSCC development, consistent with our genomic analysis implicating MEK as a chemoprevention target. Although systemic MEKi suppresses the formation of cSCC in mice, systemic MEKi can cause severe adverse effects. Here, we report the development of a metabolically labile MEKi, NFX-179, designed to potently and selectively suppress the MAPK pathway in the skin before rapid metabolism in the systemic circulation. NFX-179 was identified on the basis of its biochemical and cellular potency, selectivity, and rapid metabolism upon systemic absorption. In our ultraviolet-induced cSCC mouse model, topical application of NFX-179 gel reduced the formation of new cSCCs by an average of 60% at doses of 0.1% and greater at 28 days. We further confirmed the localized nature of these effects in an additional split-mouse randomized controlled study where suppression of cSCC was observed only in drug-treated areas. No toxicities were observed. NFX-179 inhibits the growth of human SCC cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, and topical NFX-179 application penetrates human skin and inhibits MAPK signaling in human cSCC explants. Together, our data provide a compelling rationale for using topical MEK inhibition through the application of NFX-179 gel as an effective strategy for cSCC chemoprevention.","2023-10-11","2024-05-26 07:06:23","2024-05-26 07:35:28","2024-05-26 07:06:23","eade1844","","717","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/MKU32Y3J/Sarin et al. - 2023 - Development of a MEK inhibitor, NFX-179, as a chem.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we showed that denervation resulting from transection of the sciatic nerve triggered a marked increase in the prostaglandin-degrading enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) in skeletal muscle in mice, providing evidence that injury drives early expression of this aging-associated enzyme or gerozyme. Treating mice with a small-molecule inhibitor of 15-PGDH promoted regeneration of motor axons and formation of neuromuscular synapses leading to an acceleration in recovery of force after an acute nerve crush injury. In aged mice with chronic denervation of muscles, treatment with the 15-PGDH inhibitor increased motor neuron viability and restored neuromuscular junctions and function. These presynaptic changes synergized with previously reported muscle tissue remodeling to result in a marked increase in the strength of aged muscles. We further found that 15-PGDH aggregates defined the target fibers that are histopathologic hallmarks of human neurogenic myopathies, suggesting that the gerozyme may be involved in their etiology.

Here, we demonstrate that an mRNA-lipid nanoparticle vaccine encoding a set of four highly conserved MPXV surface proteins involved in virus attachment, entry, and transmission can induce MPXV-specific immunity and heterologous protection against a lethal vaccinia virus (VACV) challenge. Compared with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), which forms the basis for the current MPXV vaccine, immunization with an mRNA-based MPXV vaccine generated superior neutralizing activity against MPXV and VACV and more efficiently inhibited spread between cells. We also observed greater Fc effector TH1-biased humoral immunity to the four MPXV antigens encoded by the vaccine, as well as to the four VACV homologs. Single MPXV antigen–encoding mRNA vaccines provided partial protection against VACV challenge, whereas multivalent vaccines combining mRNAs encoding two, three, or four MPXV antigens protected against disease-related weight loss and death equal or superior to MVA vaccination.

Chemogenetics has shown promise as a means to suppress such excitability, yet chemogenetic approaches suitable for human applications are needed. PSAM4-GlyR is a modular system based on the human α7 nicotinic acetylcholine and glycine receptors, which responds to inert chemical ligands and the clinically approved drug varenicline. Here, we demonstrated the efficacy of this channel in silencing both mouse and human sensory neurons by the activation of large shunting conductances after agonist administration. Virally mediated expression of PSAM4-GlyR in mouse sensory neurons produced behavioral hyposensitivity upon agonist administration, which was recovered upon agonist washout. Stable expression of the channel led to similar reversible suppression of pain-related behavior even after 10 months of viral delivery. Mechanical and spontaneous pain readouts were also ameliorated by PSAM4-GlyR activation in acute and joint pain inflammation mouse models. Furthermore, suppression of mechanical hypersensitivity generated by a spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain was also observed upon activation of the channel. Effective silencing of behavioral hypersensitivity was reproduced in a human model of hyperexcitability and clinical pain: PSAM4-GlyR activation decreased the excitability of human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived sensory neurons and spontaneous activity due to a gain-of-function NaV1.7 mutation causing inherited erythromelalgia.

Here, we collected sequencing and clinical data of initial-recurrent tumor pairs from 544 adult diffuse gliomas and performed multivariate analysis to identify early molecular predictors of tumor evolution in three diffuse glioma subtypes. We found that CDKN2A deletion at initial diagnosis preceded tumor necrosis and microvascular proliferation that occur at later stages of IDH-mutant glioma. Ki67 expression at diagnosis was positively correlated with acquiring hypermutation at recurrence in the IDH–wild-type glioma. In all glioma subtypes, MYC gain or MYC-target activation at diagnosis was associated with treatment-induced hypermutation at recurrence. To predict glioma evolution, we constructed CELLO2 (Cancer EvoLution for LOngitudinal data version 2), a machine learning model integrating features at diagnosis to forecast hypermutation and progression after treatment. CELLO2 successfully stratified patients into subgroups with distinct prognoses and identified a high-risk patient group featured by MYC gain with worse post-progression survival, from the low-grade IDH-mutant-noncodel subtype. We then performed chronic temozolomide-induction experiments in glioma cell lines and isogenic patient-derived gliomaspheres and demonstrated that MYC drives temozolomide resistance by promoting hypermutation. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that, by binding to open chromatin and transcriptionally active genomic regions, c-MYC increases the vulnerability of key mismatch repair genes to treatment-induced mutagenesis, thus triggering hypermutation.

We have identified that soluble folate receptor γ (FOLR3), which is expressed in humans but not in rodents, is a secreted protein that is elevated in the livers of patients with MASH but not in those with metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease, those with type II diabetes, or healthy individuals. Global proteomics showed that FOLR3 was the most highly significant MASH-specific protein and was positively correlated with increasing fibrosis stage, consistent with stimulation of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which are the key fibrogenic cells in the liver. Exposure of HSCs to exogenous FOLR3 led to elevated extracellular matrix (ECM) protein production, an effect synergistically potentiated by TGFβ1. We found that FOLR3 interacts with the serine protease HTRA1, a known regulator of TGFBR, and activates TGFβ signaling.

Here, we show that chemotherapy treatment with doxorubicin (DOX) in a breast cancer mouse model induced protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of the neuronal ryanodine receptor/calcium (Ca2+) channel type 2 (RyR2), RyR2 oxidation, RyR2 nitrosylation, RyR2 calstabin2 depletion, and subsequent RyR2 Ca2+ leakiness. Chemotherapy was furthermore associated with abnormalities in brain glucose metabolism and neurocognitive dysfunction in breast cancer mice. RyR2 leakiness and cognitive dysfunction could be ameliorated by treatment with a small molecule Rycal drug (S107). Chemobrain was also found in noncancer mice treated with DOX or methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil and could be prevented by treatment with S107. Genetic ablation of the RyR2 PKA phosphorylation site (RyR2-S2808A) also prevented the development of chemobrain. Chemotherapy increased brain concentrations of the tumor necrosis factor–α and transforming growth factor–β signaling, suggesting that increased inflammatory signaling might contribute to oxidation-driven biochemical remodeling of RyR2. Proteomics and Gene Ontology analysis indicated that the signaling downstream of chemotherapy-induced leaky RyR2 was linked to the dysregulation of synaptic structure–associated proteins that are involved in neurotransmission. Together, our study points to neuronal Ca2+ dyshomeostasis via leaky RyR2 channels as a potential mechanism contributing to chemobrain, warranting further translational studies.","2023-09-27","2024-05-26 07:07:10","2024-05-26 07:40:57","2024-05-26 07:07:10","eadf8977","","715","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/HVD73IUZ/Liu et al. - 2023 - Targeting ryanodine receptor type 2 to mitigate ch.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)–related coronaviruses (CoVs) remain a pressing concern for global health preparedness. Using metagenomic sequence data and CoV reverse genetics, we recovered a full-length wild-type MERS-like BtCoV/li/GD/2014-422 (BtCoV-422) recombinant virus, as well as two reporter viruses, and evaluated their human emergence potential and susceptibility to currently available countermeasures. Similar to MERS-CoV, BtCoV-422 efficiently used human and other mammalian dipeptidyl peptidase protein 4 (DPP4) proteins as entry receptors and an alternative DPP4-independent infection route in the presence of exogenous proteases. BtCoV-422 also replicated efficiently in primary human airway, lung endothelial, and fibroblast cells, although less efficiently than MERS-CoV. However, BtCoV-422 shows minor signs of infection in 288/330 human DPP4 transgenic mice. Several broad CoV antivirals, including nucleoside analogs and 3C-like/Mpro protease inhibitors, demonstrated potent inhibition against BtCoV-422 in vitro. Serum from mice that received a MERS-CoV mRNA vaccine showed reduced neutralizing activity against BtCoV-422. Although most MERS-CoV–neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) had limited activity, one anti-MERS receptor binding domain mAb, JC57-11, neutralized BtCoV-422 potently. A cryo–electron microscopy structure of JC57-11 in complex with BtCoV-422 spike protein revealed the mechanism of cross-neutralization involving occlusion of the DPP4 binding site, highlighting its potential as a broadly neutralizing mAb for group 2c CoVs that use DPP4 as a receptor.

Injection of anti-uPAR antibody restored β cell mass and function in D2D3 transgenic mice. At the cellular level, the D2D3 protein impaired β cell proliferation and inhibited the bioenergetics of β cells, leading to dysregulated cytoskeletal dynamics and subsequent impairment in the maturation and trafficking of insulin granules. D2D3 protein was predominantly detected in the sera of patients with nephropathy and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. These sera inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin release from human islets in a D2D3-dependent manner.

Currently, such immunotherapies are individually designed and tested for each disease. This approach is inefficient and limited to a few lineage antigens for which the on-target/off-tumor toxicities are clinically tolerated. Here, we sought to develop a universal CAR T cell therapy for blood cancers directed against the pan-leukocyte marker CD45. To protect healthy hematopoietic cells, including CAR T cells, from CD45-directed on-target/off-tumor toxicity while preserving the essential functions of CD45, we mapped the epitope on CD45 that is targeted by the CAR and used CRISPR adenine base editing to install a function-preserving mutation sufficient to evade CAR T cell recognition. Epitope-edited CD45 CAR T cells were fratricide resistant and effective against patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia, B cell lymphoma, and acute T cell leukemia. Epitope-edited hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were protected from CAR T cells and, unlike CD45 knockout cells, could engraft, persist, and differentiate in vivo. Ex vivo epitope editing in HSCs and T cells enables the safe and effective use of CD45-directed CAR T cells and bispecific T cell engagers for the universal treatment of hematologic malignancies and might be exploited for other diseases requiring intensive hematopoietic ablation.","2023-08-31","2024-05-26 07:07:17","2024-05-26 07:47:29","2024-05-26 07:07:17","eadi1145","","714","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/YYBTAW2B/Wellhausen et al. - 2023 - Epitope base editing CD45 in hematopoietic cells e.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The function and mechanisms of TP63 fusions remain unclear, and there is no target therapy for patients with lymphoma harboring TP63 fusions. Here, we show that TP63 fusions act as bona fide oncogenes and are essential for fusion-positive lymphomas. Transgenic mice expressing TBL1XR1::TP63, the most common TP63 fusion, develop diverse lymphomas that recapitulate multiple human T and B cell lymphomas. Here, we identify that TP63 fusions coordinate the recruitment of two epigenetic modifying complexes, the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR)—histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) by the N-terminal TP63 fusion partner and the lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) by the C-terminal TP63 component, which are both required for fusion-dependent survival. TBL1XR1::TP63 localization at enhancers drives a unique cell state that involves up-regulation of MYC and the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) components EED and EZH2. Inhibiting EZH2 with the therapeutic agent valemetostat is highly effective at treating transgenic lymphoma murine models, xenografts, and patient-derived xenografts harboring TP63 fusions.

Although the events leading to initial tau misfolding and subsequent tau spreading in patient brains are largely unknown, traumatic brain injury (TBI) may be a risk factor for tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Using a repetitive TBI (rTBI) paradigm, we report that rTBI induced somatic accumulation of phosphorylated and misfolded tau, as well as neurodegeneration across multiple brain areas in 7-month-old tau transgenic PS19 mice but not wild-type (WT) mice. rTBI accelerated somatic tau pathology in younger PS19 mice and WT mice only after inoculation with tau preformed fibrils and AD brain–derived pathological tau (AD-tau), respectively, suggesting that tau seeds are needed for rTBI-induced somatic tau pathology. rTBI further disrupted axonal microtubules and induced punctate tau and TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology in the optic tracts of WT mice. These changes in the optic tract were associated with a decline of visual function. Treatment with a brain-penetrant microtubule-stabilizing molecule reduced rTBI-induced tau, TDP-43 pathogenesis, and neurodegeneration in the optic tract as well as visual dysfunction. Treatment with the microtubule stabilizer also alleviated rTBI-induced tau pathology in the cortices of AD-tau–inoculated WT mice.

For patients with polycystic liver disease (PCLD), nonsurgical treatments are limited, and managing life-long abdominal swelling, pain, and increasing risk of cyst rupture and infection is common. We demonstrate here that loss of the primary cilium on postnatal biliary epithelial cells (via the deletion of the cilia gene Wdr35) drives ongoing pathological remodeling of the biliary tree, resulting in progressive cyst formation and growth. The development of cystic tissue requires the activation of transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling, which promotes the expression of a procystic, fibronectin-rich extracellular matrix and which itself is perceived by a changing profile of integrin receptors on the cystic epithelium. This signaling axis is conserved in liver cysts from patients with either autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease or autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease, indicating that there are common cellular mechanisms for liver cyst growth regardless of the underlying genetic cause. Cyst number and size can be reduced by inhibiting TGFβ signaling or integrin signaling in vivo.

Here, we found that pharmacological inhibition of phosphorylated SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (pSHP2), a facilitator of aberrant IFN-γ abundance, decreased large granuloma formation and macrophage infiltration in the lungs of mice with sarcoidosis-like disease. Positive treatment outcomes were dependent on the effective enhancement of TBET ubiquitination within CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, we identified a posttranslational modification pathway in which the E3 F-box protein S-phase kinase–associated protein 2 (SKP2) targets TBET for ubiquitination in T cells under normal conditions. However, this pathway was disrupted by aberrant pSHP2 signaling in CD8+ T cells from patients with progressive pulmonary sarcoidosis and end-stage disease. Ex vivo inhibition of pSHP2 in CD8+ T cells from patients with end-stage sarcoidosis enhanced TBET ubiquitination and suppressed IFN-γ and collagen synthesis. Therefore, these studies provided new mechanistic insights into the SHP2-dependent posttranslational regulation of TBET and identified SHP2 inhibition as a potential therapeutic intervention against severe sarcoidosis.

We used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to noninvasively study cerebral microvascular hemoglobin concentrations in 46 Malawian children with cerebral malaria. Cerebral malaria was defined by the presence of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum on a blood smear, a Blantyre coma score of 2 or less, and retinopathy. Children with uncomplicated malaria (n = 33) and healthy children (n = 29) were enrolled as comparators. Cerebral microvascular hemoglobin concentrations were higher among children with cerebral malaria compared with those with uncomplicated malaria [median (25th, 75th): 145.2 (95.2, 190.0) μM versus 82.9 (65.7, 105.4) μM, P = 0.008]. Cerebral microvascular hemoglobin concentrations correlated with brain swelling score determined by MRI (r = 0.37, P = 0.03). Fluctuations in cerebral microvascular hemoglobin concentrations over a 30-min time period were characterized using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). DFA determined self-similarity of the cerebral microvascular hemoglobin concentration signal to be lower among children with cerebral malaria compared with those with uncomplicated malaria [0.63 (0.54, 0.70) versus 0.91 (0.82, 0.94), P < 0.0001]. The lower self-similarity of the hemoglobin concentration signal in children with cerebral malaria suggested impaired regulation of cerebral blood flow. The elevated cerebral tissue hemoglobin concentration and its correlation with brain swelling suggested that excess blood volume, potentially due to vascular congestion, may contribute to brain swelling in cerebral malaria.","2023-09-13","2024-05-26 07:07:25","2024-05-26 17:44:03","2024-05-26 07:07:25","eadh4293","","713","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/HK3MUDLL/Smith et al. - 2023 - Increased brain microvascular hemoglobin concentra.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is also a complex process involving osteochondrogenic differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and abnormal deposition of minerals in the vascular wall. In an observational, multicenter European study, including 112 patients with CKD from Spain and 171 patients on dialysis from France, we used serum proteome analysis and further validation by ELISA to identify calprotectin, a circulating damage-associated molecular pattern protein, as being independently associated with CV outcome and mortality. This was confirmed in an additional cohort of 170 patients with CKD from Sweden, where increased serum calprotectin concentrations correlated with increased vascular calcification. In primary human VSMCs and mouse aortic rings, calprotectin exacerbated calcification. Treatment with paquinimod, a calprotectin inhibitor, as well as pharmacological inhibition of the receptor for advanced glycation end products and Toll-like receptor 4 inhibited the procalcifying effect of calprotectin. Paquinimod also ameliorated calcification induced by the sera of uremic patients in primary human VSMCs. Treatment with paquinimod prevented vascular calcification in mice with chronic renal failure induced by subtotal nephrectomy and in aged apolipoprotein E–deficient mice as well. These observations identified calprotectin as a key contributor of vascular calcification, and increased circulating calprotectin was strongly and independently associated with calcification, CV outcome, and mortality in patients with CKD. Inhibition of calprotectin might therefore be a promising strategy to prevent vascular calcification in patients with CKD.","2023-09-06","2024-05-26 07:07:26","2024-05-26 07:47:02","2024-05-26 07:07:26","eabn5939","","712","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/NNYJZUF7/Amaya-Garrido et al. - 2023 - Calprotectin is a contributor to and potential the.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Insights into the mechanisms that underlie postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) will be critical for the prevention and clinical management of long-term complications of COVID-19. Several hypotheses have been proposed that may account for the development of PASC, including persistence of virus and dysregulation of immune responses. Among the immunological changes noted in PASC, alterations in humoral immunity have been observed in some patient subsets. To begin to determine whether SARS-CoV-2– or other pathogen-specific humoral immune responses evolve uniquely in PASC, we performed comprehensive antibody profiling against SARS-CoV-2, a panel of endemic pathogens, and a panel of routine vaccine antigens using systems serology in two cohorts of patients with preexisting systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD) who either developed or did not develop PASC. A distinct qualitative shift observed in Fcγ receptor (FcγR) binding was observed in individuals with PASC. Specifically, individuals with PASC harbored weaker FcγR-binding anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and stronger FcγR-binding antibody responses against the endemic coronavirus OC43. Individuals with PASC developed an OC43 S2-specific antibody response with stronger FcγR binding, linked to cross-reactivity across SARS-CoV-2 and common coronaviruses. These findings identify previous coronavirus imprinting as a potential marker for the development of PASC in individuals with SARDs.","2023-09-06","2024-05-26 07:07:27","2024-05-26 07:46:19","2024-05-26 07:07:27","eadf6598","","712","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/9HJK3FV5/Herman et al. - 2023 - Humoral immunity to an endemic coronavirus is asso.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These preclinical changes have generated considerable interest in identifying markers for the pathophysiological mechanisms linked to AD and AD-related disorders (ADRD). On the basis of our prior work integrating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain proteome networks, we developed a reliable and high-throughput mass spectrometry–selected reaction monitoring assay that targets 48 key proteins altered in CSF. To test the diagnostic utility of these proteins and compare them with existing AD biomarkers, CSF collected at baseline visits was assayed from 706 participants recruited from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We found that the targeted CSF panel of 48 proteins (CSF 48 panel) performed at least as well as existing AD CSF biomarkers (Aβ42, tTau, and pTau181) for predicting clinical diagnosis, FDG PET, hippocampal volume, and measures of cognitive and dementia severity. In addition, for each of those outcomes, the CSF 48 panel plus the existing AD CSF biomarkers significantly improved diagnostic performance. Furthermore, the CSF 48 panel plus existing AD CSF biomarkers significantly improved predictions for changes in FDG PET, hippocampal volume, and measures of cognitive decline and dementia severity compared with either measure alone. A potential reason for these improvements is that the CSF 48 panel reflects a range of altered biology observed in AD/ADRD. In conclusion, we show that the CSF 48 panel complements existing AD CSF biomarkers to improve diagnosis and predict future cognitive decline and dementia severity.","2023-09-06","2024-05-26 07:07:29","2024-05-26 07:46:39","2024-05-26 07:07:29","eadg4122","","712","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/NFZXNYIR/Haque et al. - 2023 - A protein panel in cerebrospinal fluid for diagnos.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Single-cell and whole-tissue transcriptomic studies of immune cell populations in vasculitic arteries identified a CD4+ T cell population with stem cell–like features. CD4+ T cells supplying the tissue-infiltrating and tissue-damaging effector T cells survived in tertiary lymphoid structures around adventitial vasa vasora, expressed the transcription factor T cell factor 1 (TCF1), had high proliferative potential, and gave rise to two effector populations, Eomesodermin (EOMES)+ cytotoxic T cells and B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6)+ T follicular helper-like cells.

These data can complement other strategies to inform the selection of drugs based on their observed antitumor effect in situ. IMDs are integrated into surgical practice during tumor resection and remain in situ only for the duration of the otherwise standard operation (2 to 3 hours). None of the six enrolled patients experienced adverse events related to the IMD, and the exposed tissue was usable for downstream analysis for 11 out of 12 retrieved specimens. Analysis of the specimens provided preliminary evidence of the robustness of the readout, compatibility with a wide array of techniques for molecular tissue interrogation, and promising similarities with the available observed clinical-radiological responses to temozolomide.

Reduced PGC-1α abundance is linked to skeletal muscle weakness in aging or pathological conditions, such as neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes; thus, elevating PGC-1α abundance might be a promising strategy to treat muscle aging. Here, we performed high-throughput screening and identified a natural compound, farnesol, as a potent inducer of PGC-1α. Farnesol administration enhanced oxidative muscle capacity and muscle strength, leading to metabolic rejuvenation in aged mice. Moreover, farnesol treatment accelerated the recovery of muscle injury associated with enhanced muscle stem cell function. The protein expression of Parkin-interacting substrate (PARIS/Zfp746), a transcriptional repressor of PGC-1α, was elevated in aged muscles, likely contributing to PGC-1α reduction. The beneficial effect of farnesol on aged muscle was mediated through enhanced PARIS farnesylation, thereby relieving PARIS-mediated PGC-1α suppression. Furthermore, short-term exercise increased PARIS farnesylation in the muscles of young and aged mice, whereas long-term exercise decreased PARIS expression in the muscles of aged mice, leading to the elevation of PGC-1α. Collectively, the current study demonstrated that the PARIS–PGC-1α pathway is linked to muscle aging and that farnesol treatment can restore muscle functionality in aged mice through increased farnesylation of PARIS.","2023-08-30","2024-05-26 07:07:33","2024-05-26 07:48:40","2024-05-26 07:07:33","eabh3489","","711","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/WBNCQJF2/Bae et al. - 2023 - Farnesol prevents aging-related muscle weakness in.pdf","","Others","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High-throughput markers aimed at stratifying patients on the basis of shared etiology are required to ensure the success of disease-modifying therapies in clinical trials. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of PD. Previously, we found brain region–specific accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage in PD neuronal culture and animal models, as well as in human PD postmortem brain tissue. To investigate mtDNA damage as a potential blood-based marker for PD, we describe herein a PCR-based assay (Mito DNADX) that allows for the accurate real-time quantification of mtDNA damage in a scalable platform. We found that mtDNA damage was increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with idiopathic PD and those harboring the PD-associated leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) G2019S mutation in comparison with age-matched controls. In addition, mtDNA damage was elevated in non–disease-manifesting LRRK2 mutation carriers, demonstrating that mtDNA damage can occur irrespective of a PD diagnosis. We further established that Lrrk2 G2019S knock-in mice displayed increased mtDNA damage, whereas Lrrk2 knockout mice showed fewer mtDNA lesions in the ventral midbrain, compared with wild-type control mice. Furthermore, a small-molecule kinase inhibitor of LRRK2 mitigated mtDNA damage in a rotenone PD rat midbrain neuron model and in idiopathic PD patient–derived lymphoblastoid cell lines. Quantifying mtDNA damage using the Mito DNADX assay may have utility as a candidate marker of PD and for measuring the pharmacodynamic response to LRRK2 kinase inhibitors.","2023-08-30","2024-05-26 07:07:35","2024-05-26 07:47:49","2024-05-26 07:07:35","eabo1557","","711","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/6YGZSZJI/Qi et al. - 2023 - A blood-based marker of mitochondrial DNA damage i.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Blocking suppressive myeloid cells or increasing stimulatory cells to enhance antitumor immune responses is an area of interest for therapeutic intervention. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM1) is a proinflammatory receptor that amplifies immune responses. TREM1 is expressed on neutrophils, subsets of monocytes and tissue macrophages, and suppressive myeloid populations in the TME, including tumor-associated neutrophils, monocytes, and tumor-associated macrophages. Depletion or inhibition of immunosuppressive myeloid cells, or stimulation by TREM1-mediated inflammatory signaling, could be used to promote an immunostimulatory TME. We developed PY159, an afucosylated humanized anti-TREM1 monoclonal antibody with enhanced FcγR binding. PY159 is a TREM1 agonist that induces signaling, leading to up-regulation of costimulatory molecules on monocytes and macrophages, production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and enhancement of T cell activation in vitro. An antibody against mouse TREM1, PY159m, promoted antitumor efficacy in syngeneic mouse tumor models.

Through cross-phenotype meta-analysis of bone mineral density in up to 426,824 genotyped human participants along with phenotypic characterization of multiple mutant mouse lines, we identified a causative role for sulfate transporter solute carrier family 26 member A2 (SLC26A2) deficiency in osteoporosis. Ablation of SLC26A2 in osteoblasts caused severe bone loss and accumulation of immature bone cells and elicited peculiar pericellular matrix (PCM) production characterized by undersulfation coupled with decreased stiffness. These altered chemophysical properties of the PCM disrupted the formation of focal adhesions in osteoblasts. Bulk RNA sequencing and functional assays revealed that the mechanoreciprocal inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Yes1-associated transcriptional regulator (YAP)/WW domain containing transcription regulator 1 (TAZ) signaling impinged osteoblast maturation upon SLC26A2 deficiency. Moreover, pharmacological abrogation of the Hippo kinases and forced wheel-running ameliorated SLC26A2-deficient osteoporosis by promoting YAP/TAZ activity. Analysis of mouse single-cell RNA sequencing data suggested coordination among sulfate metabolism, focal adhesion, and YAP/TAZ activity during osteoblast-to-osteocyte transition. In addition to the SLC26A2-deficient setting, altered FAK and YAP/TAZ signaling was also observed in bone cells of ovariectomized mice and patients with osteoporosis, and pharmacological enforcing of YAP/TAZ activity ameliorated bone loss in ovariectomized mice. Collectively, these data unveil a role for sulfation in the developmental mechanoreciprocity between matrix and osteoblasts, which could be leveraged to prevent bone loss.","2023-08-23","2024-05-26 16:27:40","2024-05-26 16:34:32","2024-05-26 16:27:40","eadg3983","","710","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/Q7IITY4Q/Zheng et al. - 2023 - Targeting sulfation-dependent mechanoreciprocity b.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We demonstrate that complement activation is primarily mediated by the alternative pathway, and we provide a comprehensive atlas of the complement alterations around the time of respiratory deterioration. Proteomic and single-cell sequencing mapping across cell types and tissues reveals a division of labor between lung epithelial, stromal, and myeloid cells in complement production, in addition to liver-derived factors.

Both the tyrosine and global phosphoproteome as well as the proteome harbored distinctive response signatures. We found that increased pathway activity related to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibition and abundant tyrosine phosphorylation of cell junction proteins, such as CXADR and CLDN1/3, in sensitive tumors, whereas epithelial-mesenchymal transition and increased MAPK and AKT signaling were more prevalent in resistant tumors. Furthermore, the ranking of kinase activities in single samples confirmed the driver activity of ERBB2, EGFR, and MET in cetuximab-resistant tumors. This analysis also revealed high kinase activity of several members of the Src and ephrin kinase family in 2 CRC PDX models with genomically unexplained resistance. Inhibition of these hyperactive kinases, alone or in combination with cetuximab, resulted in growth inhibition of ex vivo PDX-derived organoids and in vivo PDXs.

Genetic lineage tracing study showed that endothelial regeneration after sepsis-induced vascular injury was mediated by lung resident endothelial proliferation in young adult mice, whereas this intrinsic regenerative program was impaired in aged mice. Expression of forkhead box M1 (FoxM1), an important mediator of endothelial regeneration in young mice, was not induced in lungs of aged mice. Transgenic FOXM1 expression or in vivo endothelium-targeted nanoparticle delivery of the FOXM1 gene driven by an endothelial cell (EC)–specific promoter reactivated endothelial regeneration, normalized vascular repair and resolution of inflammation, and promoted survival in aged mice after sepsis challenge. In addition, treatment with the FDA-approved DNA demethylating agent decitabine was sufficient to reactivate FoxM1-dependent endothelial regeneration in aged mice, reverse aging-impaired resolution of inflammatory injury, and promote survival. Mechanistically, aging-induced Foxm1 promoter hypermethylation in mice, which could be inhibited by decitabine treatment, inhibited Foxm1 induction after sepsis challenge. In COVID-19 lung autopsy samples, FOXM1 was not induced in vascular ECs of elderly patients in their 80s, in contrast with middle-aged patients (aged 50 to 60 years). Thus, reactivation of FoxM1-mediated endothelial regeneration and vascular repair may represent a potential therapy for elderly patients with ARDS.","2023-08-16","2024-05-26 16:27:45","2024-05-26 16:37:12","2024-05-26 16:27:45","eabm5755","","709","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/AZTRAS2F/Huang et al. - 2023 - Endothelial FoxM1 reactivates aging-impaired endot.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to establish gene therapy for the kidney by targeting a monogenic disease of the kidney podocyte. The most common cause of childhood genetic nephrotic syndrome is mutations in the podocyte gene NPHS2, encoding podocin. We used AAV-based gene therapy to rescue this genetic defect in human and mouse models of disease. In vitro transduction studies identified the AAV-LK03 serotype as a highly efficient transducer of human podocytes. AAV-LK03–mediated transduction of podocin in mutant human podocytes resulted in functional rescue in vitro, and AAV 2/9–mediated gene transfer in both the inducible podocin knockout and knock-in mouse models resulted in successful amelioration of kidney disease. A prophylactic approach of AAV 2/9 gene transfer before induction of disease in conditional knockout mice demonstrated improvements in albuminuria, plasma creatinine, plasma urea, plasma cholesterol, histological changes, and long-term survival. A therapeutic approach of AAV 2/9 gene transfer 2 weeks after disease induction in proteinuric conditional knock-in mice demonstrated improvement in urinary albuminuria at days 42 and 56 after disease induction, with corresponding improvements in plasma albumin.

Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) has emerged as a promising therapeutic target. This enzyme is minimally expressed in normal ileum and colon, but it is markedly up-regulated in biopsies from patients with IBD and preclinical colitis models. Here, we generated a class of GCPII inhibitors designed to be gut-restricted for oral administration, and we interrogated efficacy and mechanism using in vitro and in vivo models. The lead inhibitor, (S)-IBD3540, was potent (half maximal inhibitory concentration = 4 nanomolar), selective, gut-restricted (AUCcolon/plasma > 50 in mice with colitis), and efficacious in acute and chronic rodent colitis models. In dextran sulfate sodium–induced colitis, oral (S)-IBD3540 inhibited >75% of colon GCPII activity, dose-dependently improved gross and histologic disease, and markedly attenuated monocytic inflammation. In spontaneous colitis in interleukin-10 (IL-10) knockout mice, once-daily oral (S)-IBD3540 initiated after disease onset improved disease, normalized colon histology, and attenuated inflammation as evidenced by reduced fecal lipocalin 2 and colon pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, including tumor necrosis factor–α and IL-17. Using primary human colon epithelial air-liquid interface monolayers to interrogate the mechanism, we further found that (S)-IBD3540 protected against submersion-induced oxidative stress injury by decreasing barrier permeability, normalizing tight junction protein expression, and reducing procaspase-3 activation.

We analyzed mitochondrial gene expression in nasopharyngeal and autopsy tissues from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In nasopharyngeal samples with declining viral titers, the virus blocked the transcription of a subset of nuclear DNA (nDNA)–encoded mitochondrial OXPHOS genes, induced the expression of microRNA 2392, activated HIF-1α to induce glycolysis, and activated host immune defenses including the integrated stress response. In autopsy tissues from patients with COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 was no longer present, and mitochondrial gene transcription had recovered in the lungs. However, nDNA mitochondrial gene expression remained suppressed in autopsy tissue from the heart and, to a lesser extent, kidney, and liver, whereas mitochondrial DNA transcription was induced and host-immune defense pathways were activated. During early SARS-CoV-2 infection of hamsters with peak lung viral load, mitochondrial gene expression in the lung was minimally perturbed but was down-regulated in the cerebellum and up-regulated in the striatum even though no SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the brain. During the mid-phase SARS-CoV-2 infection of mice, mitochondrial gene expression was starting to recover in mouse lungs. These data suggest that when the viral titer first peaks, there is a systemic host response followed by viral suppression of mitochondrial gene transcription and induction of glycolysis leading to the deployment of antiviral immune defenses. Even when the virus was cleared and lung mitochondrial function had recovered, mitochondrial function in the heart, kidney, liver, and lymph nodes remained impaired, potentially leading to severe COVID-19 pathology.","2023-08-09","2024-05-26 16:27:51","2024-05-26 16:39:45","2024-05-26 16:27:51","eabq1533","","708","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/KJ54YBPR/Guarnieri et al. - 2023 - Core mitochondrial genes are down-regulated during.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using proximity biotinylation, coimmunoprecipitation, surface plasmon resonance, and ectopic expression, we have identified armadillo-repeat protein C10 (ArmC10) as a high-affinity receptor for Ocm. ArmC10 deletion suppressed inflammation-induced axon regeneration in the injured optic nerves of mice. ArmC10 deletion also suppressed the ability of lesioned sensory neurons to regenerate peripheral axons rapidly after a second injury and to regenerate their central axons after spinal cord injury in mice (the conditioning lesion effect). Conversely, Ocm acted through ArmC10 to accelerate optic nerve and peripheral nerve regeneration and to enable spinal cord axon regeneration in these mouse nerve injury models. We showed that ArmC10 is highly expressed in human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived sensory neurons and that exposure to Ocm altered gene expression and enhanced neurite outgrowth. ArmC10 was also expressed in human monocytes, and Ocm increased the expression of immune modulatory genes in these cells. These findings suggest that Ocm acting through its receptor ArmC10 may be a useful therapeutic target for nerve repair and immune modulation.","2023-08-09","2024-05-26 16:27:55","2024-05-26 16:38:41","2024-05-26 16:27:54","eadg6241","","708","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/3GVWWLJR/Xie et al. - 2023 - The oncomodulin receptor ArmC10 enables axon regen.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pelvic floor muscle (PFM) dysfunction has been identified as one of the leading risk factors for the development of these morbid conditions. Childbirth, specifically vaginal delivery, has been recognized as the most important potentially modifiable risk factor for PFM injury; however, the precise mechanisms of PFM dysfunction after parturition remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that PFMs exhibit atrophy and fibrosis in parous women with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse. These pathological alterations were recapitulated in a preclinical rat model of simulated birth injury (SBI). The transcriptional signature of PFMs after injury demonstrated an impairment in muscle anabolism, persistent expression of genes that promote extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, and a sustained inflammatory response. We also evaluated the administration of acellular injectable skeletal muscle ECM hydrogel for the prevention of these pathological alterations. Treatment of PFMs with the ECM hydrogel either at the time of birth injury or 4 weeks after injury mitigated PFM atrophy and fibrosis. By evaluating gene expression, we demonstrated that these changes are mainly driven by the hydrogel-induced enhancement of endogenous myogenesis, ECM remodeling, and modulation of the immune response.

Here, we studied how AS of Ceacam1 affects ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in mouse and human livers. We found that the short cytoplasmic isoform Ceacam1-S increased during early acute and late resolution phases of warm IRI injury in mice. Transfection of Ceacam1-deficient mouse hepatocytes with adenoviral Ceacam1-S mitigated hypoxia-induced loss of cellular adhesion by repressing the Ask1/p-p38 cell death pathway. Nucleic acid–blocking morpholinos, designed to selectively induce Ceacam1-S, protected hepatocyte cultures against temperature-induced stress in vitro. Luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified direct binding of hypoxia-inducible factor–1α (Hif-1α) to the mouse polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (Ptbp1) promoter region. Dimethyloxalylglycine protected mouse livers from warm IR stress and hepatocellular damage by inhibiting prolyl hydroxylase domain–containing protein 1 and promoting AS of Ceacam1-S. Last, analysis of 46 human donor liver grafts revealed that CEACAM1-S positively correlated with pretransplant HIF1A expression. This also correlated with better transplant outcomes, including reduced TIMP1, total bilirubin, proinflammatory MCP1, CXCL10 cytokines, immune activation markers IL17A, and incidence of delayed complications from biliary anastomosis.

Evidence suggests a role for T cells in glaucoma pathogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we found that the percentage of circulating CD4+ T cells expressing a gut-homing integrin β7 was increased in patients with glaucoma and was associated with disease stage. In an EIOP-triggered glaucoma mouse model, β7+ CD4+ T cells infiltrated the retina in the progressive phase of glaucoma via eliciting retinal endothelial cell expression of mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1). MAdCAM-1 was minimally detected in retinas of healthy mice, and neutralization with an MAdCAM-1 antibody ameliorated retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and glial activity in mice with glaucoma. We furthermore found that EIOP-induced β7+ CD4+ T cells homed to the gut during the acute phase of glaucoma, which was essential for progressive RGC damage in diseased mice. Gut-homing β7+ CD4+ T cells underwent transcriptional reprogramming, showing up-regulated pathways enriched in autoimmune diseases, bacteria responses, mucosal immunity, and glial activity. Gut-homing β7+ CD4+ T cells gained the competence to induce retinal MAdCAM-1 expression and to cross the blood-retina barrier.

The gut microbiome has been implicated in inflammatory conditions, but large-scale metagenomic evaluations have not yet traced the routes by which immunity in the gut affects inflammatory arthritis. To characterize the community structure and associated functional processes driving gut microbial involvement in arthritis, the Inflammatory Arthritis Microbiome Consortium investigated 440 stool shotgun metagenomes comprising 221 adults diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or psoriatic arthritis and 219 healthy controls and individuals with joint pain without an underlying inflammatory cause. Diagnosis explained about 2% of gut taxonomic variability, which is comparable in magnitude to inflammatory bowel disease. We identified several candidate microbes with differential carriage patterns in patients with elevated blood markers for inflammation. Our results confirm and extend previous findings of increased carriage of typically oral and inflammatory taxa and decreased abundance and prevalence of typical gut clades, indicating that distal inflammatory conditions, as well as local conditions, correspond to alterations to the gut microbial composition. We identified several differentially encoded pathways in the gut microbiome of patients with inflammatory arthritis, including changes in vitamin B salvage and biosynthesis and enrichment of iron sequestration. Although several of these changes characteristic of inflammation could have causal roles, we hypothesize that they are mainly positive feedback responses to changes in host physiology and immune homeostasis.

Anatomic similarity between tissues was a key determinant of TCR repertoire composition within patients, independent of disease or transplant status. The T cells recovered from peripheral blood and spleens in patients and mice captured a limited portion of the TCR repertoire detected in tissues. Whereas few T cell clones were shared across patients, motif-based clustering revealed shared repertoire signatures across patients in a tissue-specific fashion. T cells at disease sites had a tissue-resident phenotype and were of donor origin based on single-cell chimerism analysis. These data demonstrate the complex composition of T cell populations that persist in human tissues at the end stage of an inflammatory disorder after lymphocyte-directed therapy.

Experiments in rats demonstrated that adeno-associated virus (AAV)–mediated expression of ChRERα enables neural circuit manipulation in vivo and that ChRERα expression could be monitored using FES-PET imaging. In vivo experiments in nonhuman primates (NHPs) confirmed that ChRERα expression could be monitored at the site of AAV injection in the primary motor cortex and in long-range neuronal terminals for up to 80 weeks.

However, the wider use of CAR T cells has been hindered by the potential for life-threatening toxicities due to on-target off-tumor killing of cells expressing low amounts of the target antigen. CD229, a signaling lymphocyte-activation molecule (SLAM) family member, has previously been identified as a target for CAR T cell–mediated treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) due to its high expression on the surfaces of MM cells. CD229 CAR T cells have shown effective clearance of MM cells in vitro and in vivo. However, healthy lymphocytes also express CD229, albeit at lower amounts than MM cells, causing their unintended targeting by CD229 CAR T cells. To increase the selectivity of CD229 CAR T cells for MM cells, we used a single amino acid substitution approach of the CAR binding domain to reduce CAR affinity. To identify CARs with increased selectivity, we screened variant binding domains using solid-phase binding assays and biolayer interferometry and determined the cytotoxic activity of variant CAR T cells against MM cells and healthy lymphocytes. We identified a CD229 CAR binding domain with micromolar affinity that, when combined with overexpression of c-Jun, confers antitumor activity comparable to parental CD229 CAR T cells but lacks the parental cells’ cytotoxic activity toward healthy lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo.

We show that severed nerves can be divided along their fascicles and redistributed to concurrently innervate different types of muscle targets, particularly native denervated muscles and nonvascularized free muscle grafts. We engineered these neuromuscular constructs with implanted electrodes that were accessible via a permanent osseointegrated interface, allowing for bidirectional communication with the prosthesis while also providing direct skeletal attachment. We found that the transferred nerves effectively innervated their new targets as shown by a gradual increase in myoelectric signal strength. This allowed for individual flexion and extension of all five fingers of a prosthetic hand by a patient with a transhumeral amputation.

Here, we sought to understand how RNF41 dictates macrophage fate in hepatic fibrosis and repair within the inflammatory milieu. We found that RNF41 expression is down-regulated in CD11b+ macrophages recruited to mouse fibrotic liver and to patient cirrhotic liver regardless of cirrhosis etiology. Prolonged inflammation with TNF-α progressively reduced macrophage RNF41 expression. We designed a macrophage-selective gene therapy with dendrimer-graphite nanoparticles (DGNPs) to explore the influence of macrophage RNF41 restoration and depletion in liver fibrosis and regeneration. RNF41 expression induced in CD11b+ macrophages by DGNP-conjugated plasmids ameliorated liver fibrosis, reduced liver injury, and stimulated hepatic regeneration in fibrotic mice with or without hepatectomy. This therapeutic effect was mainly mediated by the induction of insulin-like growth factor 1. Conversely, depletion of macrophage RNF41 worsened inflammation, fibrosis, hepatic damage, and survival. Our data reveal implications of macrophage RNF41 in the control of hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and regeneration and provide a rationale for therapeutic strategies in chronic liver disease and potentially other diseases characterized by inflammation and fibrosis.","2023-07-12","2024-05-26 16:29:44","2024-05-26 16:47:41","2024-05-26 16:29:44","eabq6225","","704","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/K7SN2GG6/Moreno-Lanceta et al. - 2023 - RNF41 orchestrates macrophage-driven fibrosis reso.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, intrinsic or acquired resistance reduces the chemotherapeutic potential of gemcitabine. Here, we revealed a previously unappreciated mechanism by which phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancers, dominates the decision-making process that is central to the regulation of gemcitabine efficacy in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). By investigating a gemcitabine-treated CCA cohort, we found that PTEN deficiency was correlated with the improved efficacy of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Using cell-based drug sensitivity assays, cell line–derived xenograft, and patient-derived xenograft models, we further confirmed that PTEN deficiency or genetic-engineering down-regulation of PTEN facilitated gemcitabine efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, PTEN directly binds to and dephosphorylates the C terminus of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2Ac) to increase its enzymatic activity, which further dephosphorylates deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) at Ser74 to diminish gemcitabine efficacy. Therefore, PTEN deficiency and high phosphorylation of DCK predict a better response to gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in CCA. We speculate that the combination of PP2A inhibitor and gemcitabine in PTEN-positive tumors could avoid the resistance of gemcitabine, which would benefit a large population of patients with cancer receiving gemcitabine or other nucleoside analogs.","2023-07-12","2024-05-26 16:29:46","2024-05-26 16:48:17","2024-05-26 16:29:46","eadd7464","","704","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/FJ84BM8X/Jiang et al. - 2023 - PTEN deficiency facilitates gemcitabine efficacy i.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eleven (44%) children maintained HIV-1 RNA below 400 copies per milliliter through 24 weeks of bNAb-only treatment; 14 (56%) had detectable viremia above 400 copies per milliliter at a median of 4 weeks. Archived HIV-1 provirus susceptible to 10-1074, lower birth HIV-1 DNA reservoir in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, sustained viral suppression throughout early life, and combined negative qualitative HIV-1 DNA polymerase chain reaction and negative HIV-1 serology at entry were associated with maintaining suppression on bNAbs alone. This proof-of-concept study suggests that bNAbs may represent a promising treatment modality for infants and children living with HIV-1. Future studies using newer bNAb combinations with greater breadth and potency are warranted.","2023-07-05","2024-05-26 16:30:30","2024-05-26 16:49:25","2024-05-26 16:30:30","eadh0004","","703","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/CAMETCGB/Shapiro et al. - 2023 - Broadly neutralizing antibody treatment maintained.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence highlights the central role of myeloid lineage cells in the initiation and progression of MS. However, existing imaging strategies for detecting myeloid cells in the CNS cannot distinguish between beneficial and harmful immune responses. Thus, imaging strategies that specifically identify myeloid cells and their activation states are critical for MS disease staging and monitoring of therapeutic responses. We hypothesized that positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1) could be used to monitor deleterious innate immune responses and disease progression in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. We first validated TREM1 as a specific marker of proinflammatory, CNS-infiltrating, peripheral myeloid cells in mice with EAE. We show that the 64Cu-radiolabeled TREM1 antibody–based PET tracer monitored active disease with 14- to 17-fold higher sensitivity than translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO)–PET imaging, the established approach for detecting neuroinflammation in vivo. We illustrate the therapeutic potential of attenuating TREM1 signaling both genetically and pharmacologically in the EAE mice and show that TREM1-PET imaging detected responses to an FDA-approved MS therapy with siponimod (BAF312) in these animals. Last, we observed TREM1+ cells in clinical brain biopsy samples from two treatment-naïve patients with MS but not in healthy control brain tissue. Thus, TREM1-PET imaging has potential for aiding in the diagnosis of MS and monitoring of therapeutic responses to drug treatment.","2023-06-28","2024-05-26 16:30:32","2024-05-26 16:51:44","2024-05-26 16:30:32","eabm6267","","702","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/6EU32GML/Chaney et al. - 2023 - PET imaging of TREM1 identifies CNS-infiltrating m.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although resistance mechanisms have been studied extensively in ALK-driven non–small cell lung cancer, they are poorly understood in ALK-driven anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Here, we identify a survival pathway supported by the tumor microenvironment that activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ (PI3K-γ) signaling through the C-C motif chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7). We found increased PI3K signaling in patients and ALCL cell lines resistant to ALK TKIs. PI3Kγ expression was predictive of a lack of response to ALK TKI in patients with ALCL. Expression of CCR7, PI3Kγ, and PI3Kδ were up-regulated during ALK or STAT3 inhibition or degradation and a constitutively active PI3Kγ isoform cooperated with oncogenic ALK to accelerate lymphomagenesis in mice. In a three-dimensional microfluidic chip, endothelial cells that produce the CCR7 ligands CCL19/CCL21 protected ALCL cells from apoptosis induced by crizotinib. The PI3Kγ/δ inhibitor duvelisib potentiated crizotinib activity against ALCL lines and patient-derived xenografts. Furthermore, genetic deletion of CCR7 blocked the central nervous system dissemination and perivascular growth of ALCL in mice treated with crizotinib.

Alternative delivery routes may advance auditory research and also prove useful when translated to humans with progressive genetic-mediated hearing loss. Cerebrospinal fluid flow via the glymphatic system is emerging as a new approach for brain-wide drug delivery in rodents as well as humans. The cerebrospinal fluid and the fluid of the inner ear are connected via a bony channel called the cochlear aqueduct, but previous studies have not explored the possibility of delivering gene therapy via the cerebrospinal fluid to restore hearing in adult deaf mice. Here, we showed that the cochlear aqueduct in mice exhibits lymphatic-like characteristics. In vivo time-lapse magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and optical fluorescence microscopy showed that large-particle tracers injected into the cerebrospinal fluid reached the inner ear by dispersive transport via the cochlear aqueduct in adult mice. A single intracisternal injection of adeno-associated virus carrying solute carrier family 17, member 8 (Slc17A8), which encodes vesicular glutamate transporter-3 (VGLUT3), rescued hearing in adult deaf Slc17A8−/− mice by restoring VGLUT3 protein expression in inner hair cells, with minimal ectopic expression in the brain and none in the liver.

Short-term DLL4 blockade improved posttransplant survival with durable protection from gastrointestinal GVHD in particular. Unlike prior immunosuppressive strategies tested in the NHP GVHD model, anti-DLL4 interfered with a T cell transcriptional program associated with intestinal infiltration. In cross-species investigations, Notch inhibition decreased surface abundance of the gut-homing integrin α4β7 in conventional T cells while preserving α4β7 in regulatory T cells, with findings suggesting increased β1 competition for α4 binding in conventional T cells. Secondary lymphoid organ fibroblastic reticular cells emerged as the critical cellular source of Delta-like Notch ligands for Notch-mediated up-regulation of α4β7 integrin in T cells after allo-HCT. Together, DLL4-Notch blockade decreased effector T cell infiltration into the gut, with increased regulatory to conventional T cell ratios early after allo-HCT.

We have developed a long-acting subcutaneous nanofluidic implant that can be refilled transcutaneously for sustained release of the HIV drug islatravir, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor that is used for HIV PrEP. In rhesus macaques, the islatravir-eluting implants achieved constant concentrations of islatravir in plasma (median 3.14 nM) and islatravir triphosphate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (median 0.16 picomole per 106 cells) for more than 20 months.

Recently, HPV DNA tests have been developed for use in resource-limited settings, but they remain too costly for widespread use and require instruments that are often limited to centralized laboratories. To help meet the global need for low-cost cervical cancer screening, we developed a prototype, sample-to-answer, point-of-care test for HPV16 and HPV18 DNA. Our test relies on isothermal DNA amplification and lateral flow detection, two technologies that reduce the need for complex instrumentation. We integrated all test components into a low-cost, manufacturable platform, and performance of the integrated test was evaluated with synthetic samples, provider-collected clinical samples in a high-resource setting in the United States, and self-collected clinical samples in a low-resource setting in Mozambique. We demonstrated a clinically relevant limit of detection of 1000 HPV16 or HPV18 DNA copies per test. The test requires six user steps, yields results in 45 min, and can be performed using a benchtop instrument and minicentrifuge by minimally trained personnel. The projected per-test cost is <$5, and the projected instrumentation cost is <$1000. These results show the feasibility of a sample-to-answer, point-of-care HPV DNA test.

Despite proven benefits of CaMKII inhibition in numerous preclinical models of heart disease, translation of CaMKII antagonists into humans has been stymied by low potency, toxicity, and an enduring concern for adverse effects on cognition due to an established role of CaMKII in learning and memory. To address these challenges, we asked whether any clinically approved drugs, developed for other purposes, were potent CaMKII inhibitors. For this, we engineered an improved fluorescent reporter, CaMKAR (CaMKII activity reporter), which features superior sensitivity, kinetics, and tractability for high-throughput screening. Using this tool, we carried out a drug repurposing screen (4475 compounds in clinical use) in human cells expressing constitutively active CaMKII. This yielded five previously unrecognized CaMKII inhibitors with clinically relevant potency: ruxolitinib, baricitinib, silmitasertib, crenolanib, and abemaciclib. We found that ruxolitinib, an orally bioavailable and U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved medication, inhibited CaMKII in cultured cardiomyocytes and in mice. Ruxolitinib abolished arrhythmogenesis in mouse and patient-derived models of CaMKII-driven arrhythmias. A 10-min pretreatment in vivo was sufficient to prevent catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, a congenital source of pediatric cardiac arrest, and rescue atrial fibrillation, the most common clinical arrhythmia.

If blood sampling is attempted overnight, then this necessitates admission to a clinical research unit, can be stressful, and disturbs sleep. To overcome this problem and to measure free hormones within their target tissues, we used microdialysis, an ambulatory fraction collector, and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry to obtain high-resolution profiles of tissue adrenal steroids over 24 hours in 214 healthy volunteers. For validation, we compared tissue against plasma measurements in a further seven healthy volunteers. Sample collection from subcutaneous tissue was safe, well tolerated, and allowed most normal activities to continue. In addition to cortisol, we identified daily and ultradian variation in free cortisone, corticosterone, 18-hydroxycortisol, aldosterone, tetrahydrocortisol and allo-tetrahydrocortisol, and the presence of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. We used mathematical and computational methods to quantify the interindividual variability of hormones at different times of the day and develop “dynamic markers” of normality in healthy individuals stratified by sex, age, and body mass index.

Recent work suggests that the gut microbiome of symptomatic patients with AD has an altered taxonomic composition compared with that of healthy, cognitively normal control individuals. However, knowledge about changes in the gut microbiome before the onset of symptomatic AD is limited. In this cross-sectional study that accounted for clinical covariates and dietary intake, we compared the taxonomic composition and gut microbial function in a cohort of 164 cognitively normal individuals, 49 of whom showed biomarker evidence of early preclinical AD. Gut microbial taxonomic profiles of individuals with preclinical AD were distinct from those of individuals without evidence of preclinical AD. The change in gut microbiome composition correlated with β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau pathological biomarkers but not with biomarkers of neurodegeneration, suggesting that the gut microbiome may change early in the disease process. We identified specific gut bacterial taxa associated with preclinical AD. Inclusion of these microbiome features improved the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of machine learning classifiers for predicting preclinical AD status when tested on a subset of the cohort (65 of the 164 participants). Gut microbiome correlates of preclinical AD neuropathology may improve our understanding of AD etiology and may help to identify gut-derived markers of AD risk.","2023-06-14","2024-05-26 16:30:51","2024-05-26 16:55:16","2024-05-26 16:30:51","eabo2984","","700","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/PT763YB2/Ferreiro et al. - 2023 - Gut microbiome composition may be an indicator of .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given the association between gut bacteria with response to ICI therapy and subsequent IMC, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) represents a feasible way to manipulate microbial composition in patients, with a potential benefit for IMC. Here, we present a large case series of 12 patients with refractory IMC who underwent FMT from healthy donors as salvage therapy. All 12 patients had grade 3 or 4 ICI-related diarrhea or colitis that failed to respond to standard first-line (corticosteroids) and second-line immunosuppression (infliximab or vedolizumab). Ten patients (83%) achieved symptom improvement after FMT, and three patients (25%) required repeat FMT, two of whom had no subsequent response. At the end of the study, 92% achieved IMC clinical remission. 16S rRNA sequencing of patient stool samples revealed that compositional differences between FMT donors and patients with IMC before FMT were associated with a complete response after FMT. Comparison of pre- and post-FMT stool samples in patients with complete responses showed significant increases in alpha diversity and increases in the abundances of Collinsella and Bifidobacterium, which were depleted in FMT responders before FMT. Histologically evaluable complete response patients also had decreases in select immune cells, including CD8+ T cells, in the colon after FMT when compared with non-complete response patients (n = 4). This study validates FMT as an effective treatment strategy for IMC and gives insights into the microbial signatures that may play a critical role in FMT response.","2023-06-14","2024-05-26 16:30:53","2024-05-26 16:54:57","2024-05-26 16:30:53","eabq4006","","700","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ZWMMKMCK/Halsey et al. - 2023 - Microbiome alteration via fecal microbiota transpl.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their etiology, however, remains mostly unknown at present. We conducted screening for sporadic somatic mutations in 65 IA tissues (54 saccular and 11 fusiform aneurysms) and paired blood samples by whole-exome and targeted deep sequencing. We identified sporadic mutations in multiple signaling genes and examined their impact on downstream signaling pathways and gene expression in vitro and an arterial dilatation model in mice in vivo. We identified 16 genes that were mutated in at least one IA case and found that these mutations were highly prevalent (92%: 60 of 65 IAs) among all IA cases examined. In particular, mutations in six genes (PDGFRB, AHNAK, OBSCN, RBM10, CACNA1E, and OR5P3), many of which are linked to NF-κB signaling, were found in both fusiform and saccular IAs at a high prevalence (43% of all IA cases examined). We found that mutant PDGFRBs constitutively activated ERK and NF-κB signaling, enhanced cell motility, and induced inflammation-related gene expression in vitro. Spatial transcriptomics also detected similar changes in vessels from patients with IA. Furthermore, virus-mediated overexpression of a mutant PDGFRB induced a fusiform-like dilatation of the basilar artery in mice, which was blocked by systemic administration of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib. Collectively, this study reveals a high prevalence of somatic mutations in NF-κB signaling pathway–related genes in both fusiform and saccular IAs and opens a new avenue of research for developing pharmacological interventions.","2023-06-14","2024-05-26 16:30:55","2024-05-26 16:53:43","2024-05-26 16:30:55","eabq7721","","700","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/YZNEGYU4/Shima et al. - 2023 - Increased PDGFRB and NF-κB signaling caused by hig.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses revealed that activated transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) signaling resulting from Fusobacterium infection of endometrial cells led to the transition from quiescent fibroblasts to transgelin (TAGLN)–positive myofibroblasts, which gained the ability to proliferate, adhere, and migrate in vitro. Fusobacterium inoculation in a syngeneic mouse model of endometriosis resulted in a marked increase in TAGLN-positive myofibroblasts and increased number and weight of endometriotic lesions. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment largely prevented establishment of endometriosis and reduced the number and weight of established endometriotic lesions in the mouse model.

In this study, we developed a compound and method for treating “on-target” skin toxicity by blocking the drug at the site of toxicity without reducing the systemic dose reaching the tumor. We first screened for small molecules that effectively blocked the binding of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies to EGFR and identified a potential candidate, SDT-011. In silico docking predicted that SDT-011 interacted with the same residues on EGFR found to be important for the binding of EGFR inhibitors cetuximab and panitumumab. Binding of SDT-011 to EGFR reduced the binding affinity of cetuximab to EGFR and could reactivate EGFR signaling in keratinocyte cell lines, ex vivo cetuximab-treated whole human skin, and A431-injected mice. Specific small molecules were topically applied and were delivered via a slow-release system derived from biodegradable nanoparticles that penetrate the hair follicles and sebaceous glands, within which EGFR is highly expressed.

Many pulmonary diseases are associated with intraluminal airway obstruction caused by aspirated foreign bodies, virus infection, tumors, or mucus plugs intrinsic to airway disease, including cystic fibrosis (CF). Consistent with requirements for luminal O2, airway epithelia surrounding mucus plugs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) lungs are hypoxic. Despite these observations, the effects of chronic hypoxia (CH) on airway epithelial host defense functions relevant to pulmonary disease have not been investigated. Molecular characterization of resected human lungs from individuals with a spectrum of muco-obstructive lung diseases (MOLDs) or COVID-19 identified molecular features of chronic hypoxia, including increased EGLN3 expression, in epithelia lining mucus-obstructed airways. In vitro experiments using cultured chronically hypoxic airway epithelia revealed conversion to a glycolytic metabolic state with maintenance of cellular architecture. Chronically hypoxic airway epithelia unexpectedly exhibited increased MUC5B mucin production and increased transepithelial Na+ and fluid absorption mediated by HIF1α/HIF2α-dependent up-regulation of β and γENaC (epithelial Na+ channel) subunit expression. The combination of increased Na+ absorption and MUC5B production generated hyperconcentrated mucus predicted to perpetuate obstruction. Single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing analyses of chronically hypoxic cultured airway epithelia revealed transcriptional changes involved in airway wall remodeling, destruction, and angiogenesis. These results were confirmed by RNA–in situ hybridization studies of lungs from individuals with MOLD. Our data suggest that chronic airway epithelial hypoxia may be central to the pathogenesis of persistent mucus accumulation in MOLDs and associated airway wall damage.","2023-06-07","2024-05-26 16:31:20","2024-05-26 16:56:33","2024-05-26 16:31:20","eabo7728","","699","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/AR2SDKGV/Mikami et al. - 2023 - Chronic airway epithelial hypoxia exacerbates inju.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One possibility is that ZIKV may exploit the antibody-dependent enhancement of infection mechanism, mediated by cross-reactive antibodies from prior dengue virus (DENV) infection, which may exacerbate ZIKV infection during pregnancy. In this study, we investigated the impact of prior DENV infection or no DENV infection on ZIKV pathogenesis during pregnancy in a total of four female common marmosets with five or six fetuses per group. The results showed that negative-sense viral RNA copies increased in the placental and fetal tissues of DENV-immune dams but not in DENV-naïve dams. In addition, viral proteins were prevalent in endothelial cells, macrophages, and neonatal Fc receptor–expressing cells in the placental trabeculae and in neuronal cells in the brains of fetuses from DENV-immune dams. DENV-immune marmosets maintained high titers of cross-reactive ZIKV-binding antibodies that were poorly neutralizing, raising the possibility that these antibodies might be involved in the exacerbation of ZIKV infection. These findings need to be verified in a larger study, and the mechanism involved in the exacerbation of ZIKV infection in DENV-immune marmosets needs further investigation.

We identified 298 uncontrolled asthma-specific differentially expressed genes and one gene module associated with neutrophil-mediated immunity, highlighting a potential role for neutrophils in uncontrolled asthma. We also found that NET abundance was associated with nonresponse to ICS in patients. In a neutrophilic airway inflammation murine model, steroid treatment could not suppress neutrophilic inflammation and airway hyperreactivity. However, NET disruption with deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) efficiently inhibited airway hyperreactivity and inflammation. Using neutrophil-specific transcriptomic profiles, we found that CCL4L2 was associated with ICS nonresponse in asthma, which was validated in human and murine lung tissue. CCL4L2 expression was also negatively correlated with pulmonary function change after ICS treatment. In summary, steroids fail to suppress neutrophilic airway inflammation, highlighting the potential need to use alternative therapies such as leukotriene receptor antagonists or DNase I that target the neutrophil-associated phenotype.

Immune checkpoint blockade has improved survival for many patients with NSCLC, but most fail to obtain long-term benefit. Understanding the factors leading to reduced immune surveillance in NSCLC is critical in improving patient outcomes. Here, we show that human NSCLC harbors large amounts of fibrosis that correlates with reduced T cell infiltration. In murine NSCLC models, the induction of fibrosis led to increased lung cancer progression, impaired T cell immune surveillance, and failure of immune checkpoint blockade efficacy. Associated with these changes, we observed that fibrosis leads to numerically and functionally impaired dendritic cells and altered macrophage phenotypes that likely contribute to immunosuppression. Within cancer-associated fibroblasts, distinct changes within the Col13a1-expressing population suggest that these cells produce chemokines to recruit macrophages and regulatory T cells while limiting recruitment of dendritic cells and T cells. Targeting fibrosis through transforming growth factor–β receptor signaling overcame the effects of fibrosis to enhance T cell responses and improved the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade but only in the context of chemotherapy. Together, these data suggest that fibrosis in NSCLC leads to reduced immune surveillance and poor responsiveness to checkpoint blockade and highlight antifibrotic therapies as a candidate strategy to overcome immunotherapeutic resistance.","2023-06-07","2024-05-26 16:31:26","2024-05-26 16:57:17","2024-05-26 16:31:26","eadh8005","","699","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/HXUY9FB2/Herzog et al. - 2023 - Tumor-associated fibrosis impairs immune surveilla.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Glioma-associated oncogene 1 expressing (Gli1+) cells are a major source of activated fibroblasts in multiple organs, but the links between injury, inflammation, and Gli1+ cell expansion and tissue fibrosis remain incompletely understood. We demonstrated that leukocyte-derived tumor necrosis factor (TNF) promoted Gli1+ cell proliferation and cardiorenal fibrosis through induction and release of Indian Hedgehog (IHH) from renal epithelial cells. Using single-cell–resolution transcriptomic analysis, we identified an “inflammatory” proximal tubular epithelial (iPT) population contributing to TNF- and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)–induced IHH production in vivo. TNF-induced Ubiquitin D (Ubd) expression was observed in human proximal tubular cells in vitro and during murine and human renal disease and aging. Studies using pharmacological and conditional genetic ablation of TNF-induced IHH signaling revealed that IHH activated canonical Hedgehog signaling in Gli1+ cells, which led to their activation, proliferation, and fibrosis within the injured and aging kidney and heart. These changes were inhibited in mice by Ihh deletion in Pax8-expressing cells or by pharmacological blockade of TNF, NF-κB, or Gli1 signaling. Increased amounts of circulating IHH were associated with loss of renal function and higher rates of cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Here, we identified 15 de novo missense variants in the PSMC3 gene encoding the AAA-ATPase proteasome subunit PSMC3/Rpt5 in 23 unrelated heterozygous patients with an autosomal dominant form of neurodevelopmental delay and intellectual disability. Expression of PSMC3 variants in mouse neuronal cultures led to altered dendrite development, and deletion of the PSMC3 fly ortholog Rpt5 impaired reversal learning capabilities in fruit flies. Structural modeling as well as proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of T cells derived from patients with PSMC3 variants implicated the PSMC3 variants in proteasome dysfunction through disruption of substrate translocation, induction of proteotoxic stress, and alterations in proteins controlling developmental and innate immune programs. The proteostatic perturbations in T cells from patients with PSMC3 variants correlated with a dysregulation in type I interferon (IFN) signaling in these T cells, which could be blocked by inhibition of the intracellular stress sensor protein kinase R (PKR). These results suggest that proteotoxic stress activated PKR in patient-derived T cells, resulting in a type I IFN response. The potential relationship among proteosome dysfunction, type I IFN production, and neurodevelopment suggests new directions in our understanding of pathogenesis in some neurodevelopmental disorders.","2023-05-31","2024-05-26 16:31:29","2024-05-26 16:59:25","2024-05-26 16:31:29","eabo3189","","698","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/5RSJFGPN/Ebstein et al. - 2023 - PSMC3 proteasome subunit variants are associated w.pdf","","Others","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this challenge, we first established PTEN-deficient melanoma brain metastasis mouse models and characterized them to be more immunosuppressive compared with primary melanoma, mimicking the clinical settings. Next, we developed an allogeneic twin stem cell (TSC) system composed of two tumor-targeting stem cell (SC) populations. One SC was loaded with oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV), and the other SC was CRISPR-Cas9 gene-edited to knock out nectin 1 (N1) receptor (N1KO) to acquire resistance to oHSV and release immunomodulators, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Using mouse models of brain metastatic BRAFV600E/PTEN−/− and BRAFV600E/wt/PTEN−/− mutant melanomas, we show that locoregional delivery of TSCs releasing oHSV and GM-CSF (TSC-G) activated dendritic cell– and T cell–mediated immune responses. In addition, our strategy exhibited greater therapeutic efficacy when compared with the existing oncolytic viral therapeutic approaches. Moreover, the TSCs composed of SC-oHSV and SCN1KO–releasing GM-CSF and single-chain variable fragment anti–PD-1 (TSC-G/P) had therapeutic efficacy in both syngeneic and patient-derived humanized mouse models of leptomeningeal metastasis.

However, only 50% of patients benefit from this therapy. If progression to advanced disease occurs, then patients must undergo a radical cystectomy with risks of substantial morbidity and poor clinical outcome. Identifying tumors unlikely to respond to BCG can translate into alternative treatments, such as early radical cystectomy, targeted therapies, or immunotherapies. Here, we conducted molecular profiling of 132 patients with BCG-naive HR-NMIBC and 44 patients with recurrences after BCG (34 matched), which uncovered three distinct BCG response subtypes (BRS1, 2 and BRS3). Patients with BRS3 tumors had a reduced recurrence-free and progression-free survival compared with BRS1/2. BRS3 tumors expressed high epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and basal markers and had an immunosuppressive profile, which was confirmed with spatial proteomics. Tumors that recurred after BCG were enriched for BRS3. BRS stratification was validated in a second cohort of 151 BCG-naive patients with HR-NMIBC, and the molecular subtypes outperformed guideline-recommended risk stratification based on clinicopathological variables. For clinical application, we confirmed that a commercially approved assay was able to predict BRS3 tumors with an area under the curve of 0.87. These BCG response subtypes will allow for improved identification of patients with HR-NMIBC at the highest risk of progression and have the potential to be used to select more appropriate treatments for patients unlikely to respond to BCG.","2023-05-24","2024-05-26 16:32:04","2024-05-26 17:44:14","2024-05-26 16:32:04","eabn4118","","697","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/QVIAEVIW/de Jong et al. - 2023 - Non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer molecular subty.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of tACS on cognitive function across 102 published studies, which included 2893 individuals in healthy, aging, and neuropsychiatric populations. A total of 304 effects were extracted from these 102 studies. We found modest to moderate improvements in cognitive function with tACS treatment that were evident in several cognitive domains, including working memory, long-term memory, attention, executive control, and fluid intelligence. Improvements in cognitive function were generally stronger after completion of tACS (“offline” effects) than during tACS treatment (“online” effects). Improvements in cognitive function were greater in studies that used current flow models to optimize or confirm neuromodulation targets by stimulating electric fields generated in the brain by tACS protocols. In studies targeting multiple brain regions concurrently, cognitive function changed bidirectionally (improved or decreased) according to the relative phase, or alignment, of the alternating current in the two brain regions (in phase versus antiphase). We also noted improvements in cognitive function separately in older adults and in individuals with neuropsychiatric illnesses. Overall, our findings contribute to the debate surrounding the effectiveness of tACS for cognitive rehabilitation, quantitatively demonstrate its potential, and indicate further directions for optimal tACS clinical study design.","2023-05-24","2024-05-26 16:32:06","2024-05-26 17:01:17","2024-05-26 16:32:06","eabo2044","","697","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/MVFX36G3/Grover et al. - 2023 - A meta-analysis suggests that tACS improves cognit.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we investigated combination therapies based on L19TNF, an antibody-cytokine fusion protein based on tumor necrosis factor that selectively localizes to cancer neovasculature. Using immunocompetent orthotopic glioma mouse models, we identified strong anti-glioma activity of L19TNF in combination with the alkylating agent CCNU, which cured the majority of tumor-bearing mice, whereas monotherapies only had limited efficacy. In situ and ex vivo immunophenotypic and molecular profiling in the mouse models revealed that L19TNF and CCNU induced tumor DNA damage and treatment-associated tumor necrosis. In addition, this combination also up-regulated tumor endothelial cell adhesion molecules, promoted the infiltration of immune cells into the tumor, induced immunostimulatory pathways, and decreased immunosuppression pathways. MHC immunopeptidomics demonstrated that L19TNF and CCNU increased antigen presentation on MHC class I molecules. The antitumor activity was T cell dependent and completely abrogated in immunodeficient mouse models. On the basis of these encouraging results, we translated this treatment combination to patients with glioblastoma.

Drug encapsulation into liposomal nanocarriers has shown clinical success at improving biodistribution and tolerability of chemotherapy. However, enhancements in drug efficacy have been limited because of a lack of selectivity of the liposomal formulations for the cancer cells. Here, we report on the generation of bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) with dual binding to a leukemic cell receptor, such as CD19, CD20, CD22, or CD38, and methoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG) for the targeted delivery of PEGylated liposomal drugs to leukemia cells. This liposome targeting system follows a “mix-and-match” principle where BsAbs were selected on the specific receptors expressed on leukemia cells. BsAbs improved the targeting and cytotoxic activity of a clinically approved and low-toxic PEGylated liposomal formulation of doxorubicin (Caelyx) toward leukemia cell lines and patient-derived samples that are immunophenotypically heterogeneous and representative of high-risk subtypes of childhood leukemia. BsAb-assisted improvements in leukemia cell targeting and cytotoxic potency of Caelyx correlated with receptor expression and were minimally detrimental in vitro and in vivo toward expansion and functionality of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and hematopoietic progenitors. Targeted delivery of Caelyx using BsAbs further enhanced leukemia suppression while reducing drug accumulation in the heart and kidneys and extended overall survival in patient-derived xenograft models of high-risk childhood leukemia. Our methodology using BsAbs therefore represents an attractive targeting platform to potentiate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of liposomal drugs for improved treatment of high-risk leukemia.","2023-05-17","2024-05-26 16:32:14","2024-05-26 17:02:37","2024-05-26 16:32:14","eabm1262","","696","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/F9FMUYS6/Moles et al. - 2023 - Delivery of PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin by bis.pdf","","Log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, we show that female mice are more resilient than males to chronic circadian misalignment and that these differences are conserved in humans.","2023-05-17","2024-05-26 16:32:15","2024-05-26 17:03:54","2024-05-26 16:32:15","eabo2022","","696","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/QXWVLKM7/Anderson et al. - 2023 - Sexual dimorphism in the response to chronic circa.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By performing targeted lipidomics analyses, we found that ceramides accumulated in skeletal muscle with increasing age across Caenorhabditis elegans, mice, and humans. Inhibition of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the rate-limiting enzyme of the ceramide de novo synthesis, by gene silencing or by treatment with myriocin restored proteostasis and mitochondrial function in human myoblasts, in C. elegans, and in the skeletal muscles of mice during aging. Restoration of these age-related processes improved health and life span in the nematode and muscle health and fitness in mice.

Here, we directly obtained thyroid specimens from individuals with ICI-thyroiditis, one of the most common IRAEs, and compared immune infiltrates with those from individuals with spontaneous autoimmune Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) or no thyroid disease. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a dominant, clonally expanded population of thyroid-infiltrating cytotoxic CXCR6+ CD8+ T cells (effector CD8+ T cells) present in ICI-thyroiditis but not HT or healthy controls. Furthermore, we identified a crucial role for interleukin-21 (IL-21), a cytokine secreted by intrathyroidal T follicular (TFH) and T peripheral helper (TPH) cells, as a driver of these thyrotoxic effector CD8+ T cells. In the presence of IL-21, human CD8+ T cells acquired the activated effector phenotype with up-regulation of the cytotoxic molecules interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and granzyme B, increased expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR6, and thyrotoxic capacity. We validated these findings in vivo using a mouse model of IRAEs and further demonstrated that genetic deletion of IL-21 signaling protected ICI-treated mice from thyroid immune infiltration.

Autologous neutralizing antibodies (aNAbs) represent a key adaptive immune response in people living with HIV-1. We aimed to investigate the role of aNAbs in shaping post-ATI HIV-1 rebound variants. We performed single-genome amplification of HIV-1 env from pre-ART and post-ATI plasma samples of 12 individuals who initiated ART early after infection. aNAb activity was quantified using pseudoviruses derived from the most common plasma variant, and the serum dilution that inhibited 50% of viral infections was determined. aNAb responses matured while participants were on suppressive ART, because on-ART plasma and purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) demonstrated improved neutralizing activity against pre-ART HIV-1 strains when compared with pre-ART plasma or purified IgG. Post-ATI aNAb responses exerted selective pressure on the rebounding viruses, because the post-ATI HIV-1 strains were more resistant to post-ATI plasma neutralization compared with the pre-ART virus. Several pre-ATI features distinguished post-treatment controllers from noncontrollers, including an infecting HIV-1 sequence that was more similar to consensus HIV-1 subtype B, more restricted proviral diversity, and a stronger aNAb response. Post-treatment control was also associated with the evolution of distinct N-glycosylation profiles in the HIV-1 envelope. In summary, aNAb responses appeared to mature after early initiation of ART and applied selective pressure on rebounding viruses. The combination of aNAb activity with select HIV-1 sequence and reservoir features identified individuals with a greater chance of post-treatment control.","2023-05-10","2024-05-26 16:32:22","2024-05-26 17:44:17","2024-05-26 16:32:22","eabq4490","","695","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/XLJPYW7V/Esmaeilzadeh et al. - 2023 - Autologous neutralizing antibodies increase with e.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Activation of the p38α MAPK isoform and mislocalization of the p38γ MAPK isoform are associated with neuroinflammation and synaptic degeneration in DLB and PD. Therefore, we hypothesized that p38α might be associated with neuronal p38γ distribution and synaptic dysfunction in these diseases. To test this hypothesis, we treated in vitro cellular and in vivo mouse models of DLB/PD with SKF-86002, a compound that attenuates inflammation by inhibiting p38α/β, and then investigated the effects of this compound on p38γ and neurodegenerative pathology. We found that inhibition of p38α reduced neuroinflammation and ameliorated synaptic, neurodegenerative, and motor behavioral deficits in transgenic mice overexpressing human α-synuclein. Moreover, treatment with SKF-86002 promoted the redistribution of p38γ to synapses and reduced the accumulation of α-synuclein in mice overexpressing human α-synuclein. Supporting the potential value of targeting p38 in DLB/PD, we found that SKF-86002 promoted the redistribution of p38γ in neurons differentiated from iPS cells derived from patients with familial PD (carrying the A53T α-synuclein mutation) and healthy controls. Treatment with SKF-86002 ameliorated α-synuclein–induced neurodegeneration in these neurons only when microglia were pretreated with this compound. However, direct treatment of neurons with SKF-86002 did not affect α-synuclein–induced neurotoxicity, suggesting that SKF-86002 treatment inhibits α-synuclein–induced neurotoxicity mediated by microglia.

B7 homolog 3 protein (B7-H3/CD276) is an immune checkpoint molecule and has emerged as a promising therapeutic target. However, much remains to be understood regarding B7-H3’s role in cancer progression, predictive biomarkers for B7-H3–targeted therapy, and combinatorial strategies. Our multi-omics analyses identified B7-H3 as one of the most abundant immune checkpoints in prostate tumors containing PTEN and TP53 genetic inactivation. Here, we sought in vivo genetic evidence for, and mechanistic understanding of, the role of B7-H3 in PTEN/TP53-deficient prostate cancer. We found that loss of PTEN and TP53 induced B7-H3 expression by activating transcriptional factor Sp1. Prostate-specific deletion of Cd276 resulted in delayed tumor progression and reversed the suppression of tumor-infiltrating T cells and NK cells in Pten/Trp53 genetically engineered mouse models. Furthermore, we tested the efficacy of the B7-H3 inhibitor in preclinical models of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We demonstrated that enriched regulatory T cells and elevated programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in myeloid cells hinder the therapeutic efficacy of B7-H3 inhibition in prostate tumors. Last, we showed that B7-H3 inhibition combined with blockade of PD-L1 or cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) achieved durable antitumor effects and had curative potential in a PTEN/TP53-deficient CRPC model.

We showed in cell lines, PDXs, and publicly available patient datasets that basal PDAC was characterized by inactivation of the integrated stress response (ISR), which leads to a higher rate of global mRNA translation. Moreover, we identified the histone deacetylase sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) as a critical regulator of a constitutively active ISR. Using expression analysis, polysome sequencing, immunofluorescence, and cycloheximide chase experiments, we found that SIRT6 regulated protein stability by binding activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) in nuclear speckles and protecting it from proteasomal degradation. In human PDAC cell lines and organoids as well as in murine PDAC genetically engineered mouse models where SIRT6 was deleted or down-regulated, we demonstrated that SIRT6 loss both defined the basal PDAC subtype and led to reduced ATF4 protein stability and a nonfunctional ISR, causing a marked vulnerability to CDK7 and CDK9 inhibitors.

Here, we report that neuropilin-2 (NRP2), which functions as a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor on tumor cells, is an attractive target to activate antitumor immunity in prostate cancer because VEGF-NRP2 signaling sustains PD-L1 expression. NRP2 depletion increased T cell activation in vitro. In a syngeneic model of prostate cancer that is resistant to ICI, inhibition of the binding of VEGF to NRP2 using a mouse-specific anti-NRP2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) resulted in necrosis and tumor regression compared with both an anti–PD-L1 mAb and control immunoglobulin G. This therapy also decreased tumor PD-L1 expression and increased immune cell infiltration. We observed that the NRP2, VEGFA, and VEGFC genes are amplified in metastatic castration-resistant and neuroendocrine prostate cancer. We also found that individuals with NRP2High PD-L1High metastatic tumors had lower androgen receptor expression and higher neuroendocrine prostate cancer scores than other individuals with prostate cancer. In organoids derived from patients with neuroendocrine prostate cancer, therapeutic inhibition of VEGF binding to NRP2 using a high-affinity humanized mAb suitable for clinical use also diminished PD-L1 expression and caused a substantial increase in immune-mediated tumor cell killing, consistent with the animal studies.

Using triple-negative breast cancer as a model, we demonstrated that aNRP2-10 could be used to isolate cancer stem cells (CSCs) from heterogeneous tumor populations and inhibit CSC function and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. aNRP2-10 sensitized cell lines, organoids, and xenografts to chemotherapy and inhibited metastasis by promoting the differentiation of CSCs to a state that is more responsive to chemotherapy and less prone to metastasis.

Given that spinal neural circuits constitute the final pathway for motor control, we sought to determine their contribution to this movement disorder. Focusing on the most common inherited form of dystonia in humans, DYT1-TOR1A, we generated a conditional knockout of the torsin family 1 member A (Tor1a) gene in the mouse spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). We found that these mice recapitulated the phenotype of the human condition, developing early-onset generalized torsional dystonia. Motor signs emerged early in the mouse hindlimbs before spreading caudo-rostrally to affect the pelvis, trunk, and forelimbs throughout postnatal maturation. Physiologically, these mice bore the hallmark features of dystonia, including spontaneous contractions at rest and excessive and disorganized contractions, including cocontractions of antagonist muscle groups, during voluntary movements. Spontaneous activity, disorganized motor output, and impaired monosynaptic reflexes, all signs of human dystonia, were recorded from isolated mouse spinal cords from these conditional knockout mice. All components of the monosynaptic reflex arc were affected, including motor neurons. Given that confining the Tor1a conditional knockout to DRG did not lead to early-onset dystonia, we conclude that the pathophysiological substrate of this mouse model of dystonia lies in spinal neural circuits. Together, these data provide new insights into our current understanding of dystonia pathophysiology.","2023-05-03","2024-05-26 16:32:32","2024-05-26 17:44:19","2024-05-26 16:32:32","eadg3904","","694","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/XFVMTXDC/Pocratsky et al. - 2023 - Pathophysiology of Dyt1-Tor1a dystonia in mice is .pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bacterial species associated with BSIs in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) commonly colonize the preterm infant gut microbiome. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the gut microbiome is a reservoir of BSI-causing pathogenic strains that increase in abundance before BSI onset. We analyzed 550 previously published fecal metagenomes from 115 hospitalized neonates and found that recent ampicillin, gentamicin, or vancomycin exposure was associated with increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae in infant guts. We then performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing on 462 longitudinal fecal samples from 19 preterm infants (cases) with BSI and 37 non-BSI controls, along with whole-genome sequencing of the BSI isolates. Infants with BSI caused by Enterobacteriaceae were more likely than infants with BSI caused by other organisms to have had ampicillin, gentamicin, or vancomycin exposure in the 10 days before BSI. Relative to controls, gut microbiomes of cases had increased relative abundance of the BSI-causing species and clustered by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity according to BSI pathogen. We demonstrated that 11 of 19 (58%) of gut microbiomes before BSI, and 15 of 19 (79%) of gut microbiomes at any time, harbored the BSI isolate with fewer than 20 genomic substitutions. Last, BSI strains from the Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae families were detected in multiple infants, indicating BSI-strain transmission.

Although the mechanisms initiating IPF remain unclear, rare and common alleles of genes expressed in lung epithelia, combined with aging, contribute to the risk for this condition. Consistently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies have identified lung basal cell heterogeneity in IPF that might be pathogenic. We used single-cell cloning technologies to generate “libraries” of basal stem cells from the distal lungs of 16 patients with IPF and 10 controls. We identified a major stem cell variant that was distinguished from normal stem cells by its ability to transform normal lung fibroblasts into pathogenic myofibroblasts in vitro and to activate and recruit myofibroblasts in clonal xenografts. This profibrotic stem cell variant, which was shown to preexist in low quantities in normal and even fetal lungs, expressed a broad network of genes implicated in organ fibrosis and showed overlap in gene expression with abnormal epithelial signatures identified in previously published scRNA-seq studies of IPF. Drug screens highlighted specific vulnerabilities of this profibrotic variant to inhibitors of epidermal growth factor and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling as prospective therapeutic targets. This profibrotic stem cell variant in IPF was distinct from recently identified profibrotic stem cell variants in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and may extend the notion that inappropriate accrual of minor and preexisting stem cell variants contributes to chronic lung conditions.","2023-04-26","2024-05-26 16:32:35","2024-05-26 17:08:10","2024-05-26 16:32:35","eabp9528","","693","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/TUYMN8X6/Wang et al. - 2023 - Cloning a profibrotic stem cell variant in idiopat.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering the crucial role of immunomodulating genes such as that encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells type 2 (TREM2) in removing pathogenic amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and regulating neurodegeneration in the brain, our aim was to investigate whether and how sleep loss influences microglial function in mice. We chronically sleep-deprived wild-type mice and the 5xFAD mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis, expressing either the humanized TREM2 common variant, the loss-of-function R47H AD-associated risk variant, or without TREM2 expression. Sleep deprivation not only enhanced TREM2-dependent Aβ plaque deposition compared with 5xFAD mice with normal sleeping patterns but also induced microglial reactivity that was independent of the presence of parenchymal Aβ plaques. We investigated lysosomal morphology using transmission electron microscopy and found abnormalities particularly in mice without Aβ plaques and also observed lysosomal maturation impairments in a TREM2-dependent manner in both microglia and neurons, suggesting that changes in sleep modified neuro-immune cross-talk. Unbiased transcriptome and proteome profiling provided mechanistic insights into functional pathways triggered by sleep deprivation that were unique to TREM2 and Aβ pathology and that converged on metabolic dyshomeostasis. Our findings highlight that sleep deprivation directly affects microglial reactivity, for which TREM2 is required, by altering the metabolic ability to cope with the energy demands of prolonged wakefulness, leading to further Aβ deposition, and underlines the importance of sleep modulation as a promising future therapeutic approach.","2023-04-26","2024-05-26 23:59:20","2024-05-27 00:06:35","2024-05-26 23:59:20","eade6285","","693","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/RJ4C3U6D/Parhizkar et al. - 2023 - Sleep deprivation exacerbates microglial reactivit.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein is a key antigen for vaccine development, and its prefusion conformation is the target of the most potent neutralizing antibodies. Here, we describe a computational and experimental strategy for designing immunogens that enhance the conformational stability and immunogenicity of RSV prefusion F. We obtained an optimized vaccine antigen after screening nearly 400 engineered F constructs. Through in vitro and in vivo characterization studies, we identified F constructs that are more stable in the prefusion conformation and elicit ~10-fold higher serum-neutralizing titers in cotton rats than DS-Cav1. The stabilizing mutations of the lead construct (847) were introduced onto F glycoprotein backbones of strains representing the dominant circulating genotypes of the two major RSV subgroups, A and B. Immunization of cotton rats with a bivalent vaccine formulation of these antigens conferred complete protection against RSV challenge, with no evidence of disease enhancement. The resulting bivalent RSV prefusion F investigational vaccine has recently been shown to be efficacious against RSV disease in two pivotal phase 3 efficacy trials, one for passive protection of infants by immunization of pregnant women and the second for active protection of older adults by direct immunization.","2023-04-06","2024-05-26 23:59:24","2024-05-27 00:10:40","2024-05-26 23:59:24","eade6422","","693","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/2G8I5K9A/Che et al. - 2023 - Rational design of a highly immunogenic prefusion-.pdf","","Log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In clinical epidemiological analyses, we identified a relationship between beta-blocker use and anthracycline chemotherapy in protecting against TNBC progression, disease recurrence, and mortality. We recapitulated the effect of beta-blockade on anthracycline efficacy in xenograft mouse models of TNBC. In metastatic 4T1.2 and MDA-MB-231 mouse models of TNBC, beta-blockade improved the efficacy of the anthracycline doxorubicin by reducing metastatic development. We found that anthracycline chemotherapy alone, in the absence of beta-blockade, increased sympathetic nerve fiber activity and norepinephrine concentration in mammary tumors through the induction of nerve growth factor (NGF) by tumor cells. Moreover, using preclinical models and clinical samples, we found that anthracycline chemotherapy up-regulated β2-adrenoceptor expression and amplified receptor signaling in tumor cells. Neurotoxin inhibition of sympathetic neural signaling in mammary tumors using 6-hydroxydopamine or genetic deletion of NGF or β2-adrenoceptor in tumor cells enhanced the therapeutic effect of anthracycline chemotherapy by reducing metastasis in xenograft mouse models. These findings reveal a neuromodulatory effect of anthracycline chemotherapy that undermines its potential therapeutic impact, which can be overcome by inhibiting β2-adrenergic signaling in the tumor microenvironment.

Amyloid burden in the MB correlates with pathological diagnosis of AD in human postmortem brain tissue. Whether and how MB neuronal circuitry contributes to neurodegeneration and memory deficits in AD are unknown. Using 5xFAD mice and postmortem MB samples from individuals with varying degrees of AD pathology, we identified two neuronal cell types in the MB harboring distinct electrophysiological properties and long-range projections: lateral neurons and medial neurons. lateral MB neurons harbored aberrant hyperactivity and exhibited early neurodegeneration in 5xFAD mice compared with lateral MB neurons in wild-type littermates. Inducing hyperactivity in lateral MB neurons in wild-type mice impaired performance on memory tasks, whereas attenuating aberrant hyperactivity in lateral MB neurons ameliorated memory deficits in 5xFAD mice.

This first-in-human dose-escalation open-label phase 1 clinical trial (NCT03814720) tested an HA stabilized stem ferritin nanoparticle vaccine (H1ssF) based on the H1 HA stem of A/New Caledonia/20/1999.

Thirty-five (74%) 60-μg dose participants received the boost, whereas 11 (23%) boost vaccinations were missed because of public health restrictions in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of H1ssF, and the secondary objective was to evaluate antibody responses after vaccination. H1ssF was safe and well tolerated, with mild solicited local and systemic reactogenicity. The most common symptoms included pain or tenderness at the injection site (n = 10, 19%), headache (n = 10, 19%), and malaise (n = 6, 12%). We found that H1ssF elicited cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against the conserved HA stem of group 1 influenza viruses, despite previous H1 subtype head-specific immunity.

We observed both a strong plasmablast response and sustained elicitation of cross-reactive HA stem–specific memory B cells after vaccination with H1ssF in individuals of all ages. The B cell response was focused on two conserved epitopes on the H1 stem, with a highly restricted immunoglobulin repertoire unique to each epitope. On average, two-thirds of the B cell and serological antibody response recognized a central epitope on the H1 stem and exhibited broad neutralization across group 1 influenza virus subtypes.

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major tau dephosphorylating phosphatase, and a decrease in its activity has been demonstrated in tauopathies, including Alzheimer’s disease. Prolyl oligopeptidase is a serine protease that is associated with neurodegeneration, and its inhibition normalizes PP2A activity without toxicity under pathological conditions. Here, we assessed whether prolyl oligopeptidase inhibition could protect against tau-mediated toxicity in cellular models in vitro and in the PS19 transgenic mouse model of tauopathy carrying the human tau-P301S mutation. We show that inhibition of prolyl oligopeptidase with the inhibitor KYP-2047 reduced tau aggregation in tau-transfected HEK-293 cells and N2A cells as well as in human iPSC–derived neurons carrying either the P301L or tau-A152T mutation. Treatment with KYP-2047 resulted in increased PP2A activity and activation of autophagic flux in HEK-293 cells and N2A cells and in patient-derived iNeurons, as indicated by changes in autophagosome and autophagy receptor markers; this contributed to clearance of insoluble tau. Furthermore, treatment of PS19 transgenic mice for 1 month with KYP-2047 reduced tau burden in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid and slowed cognitive decline according to several behavioral tests. In addition, a reduction in an oxidative stress marker was seen in mouse brains after KYP-2047 treatment. This study suggests that inhibition of prolyl oligopeptidase could help to ameliorate tau-dependent neurodegeneration.","2023-04-12","2024-05-26 23:59:37","2024-05-27 00:10:12","2024-05-26 23:59:37","eabq2915","","691","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ZJ4N4WRN/Eteläinen et al. - 2023 - A prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitor reduces tau path.pdf","","⭐️; Zero; Others","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using multiomics analysis of CD8+ T cell features across multiple patient cohorts and tumor types, we identified tumor niche–dependent exhausted and other types of hypofunctional CD8+ T cell states. CD8+ T cells in “supportive” niches, like melanoma or lung cancer, exhibited features of tumor reactivity–driven exhaustion (CD8+ TEX). These included a proficient effector memory phenotype, an expanded T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire linked to effector exhaustion signaling, and a cancer-relevant T cell–activating immunopeptidome composed of largely shared cancer antigens or neoantigens. In contrast, “nonsupportive” niches, like glioblastoma, were enriched for features of hypofunctionality distinct from canonical exhaustion. This included immature or insufficiently activated T cell states, high wound healing signatures, nonexpanded TCR repertoires linked to anti-inflammatory signaling, high T cell–recognizable self-epitopes, and an antiproliferative state linked to stress or prodeath responses. In situ spatial mapping of glioblastoma highlighted the prevalence of dysfunctional CD4+:CD8+ T cell interactions, whereas ex vivo single-cell secretome mapping of glioblastoma CD8+ T cells confirmed negligible effector functionality and a promyeloid, wound healing–like chemokine profile. Within immuno-oncology clinical trials, anti–programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy facilitated glioblastoma’s tolerogenic disparities, whereas dendritic cell (DC) vaccines partly corrected them. Accordingly, recipients of a DC vaccine for glioblastoma had high effector memory CD8+ T cells and evidence of antigen-specific immunity.

The brain stem location of these tumors limits the clinical management of DIPG, resulting in poor outcomes for patients. A heterozygous, somatic point mutation in one of two genes coding for the noncanonical histone H3.3 is present in most DIPG tumors. This dominant mutation in the H3-3A gene results in replacement of lysine 27 with methionine (K27M) and causes a global reduction of trimethylation on K27 of all wild-type histone H3 proteins, which is thought to be a driving event in gliomagenesis. In this study, we designed and systematically screened 2′-O-methoxyethyl phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that direct RNase H–mediated knockdown of H3-3A mRNA. We identified a lead ASO that effectively reduced H3-3A mRNA and H3.3K27M protein and restored global H3K27 trimethylation in patient-derived neurospheres. We then tested the lead ASO in two mouse models of DIPG: an immunocompetent mouse model using transduced mutant human H3-3A cDNA and an orthotopic xenograft with patient-derived cells. In both models, ASO treatment restored K27 trimethylation of histone H3 proteins and reduced tumor growth, promoted neural stem cell differentiation into astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes, and increased survival. These results demonstrate the involvement of the H3.3K27M oncohistone in tumor maintenance, confirm the reversibility of the aberrant epigenetic changes it promotes, and provide preclinical proof of concept for DMG antisense therapy.","2023-04-12","2024-05-26 23:59:40","2024-05-27 00:08:40","2024-05-26 23:59:40","eadd8280","","691","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/7DPAXFGC/Zhang et al. - 2023 - Antisense oligonucleotide therapy for H3.3K27M dif.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the required systemic immunosuppression associated with this procedure prevents this cell replacement therapy from more widespread adoption in larger patient populations. We report the editing of primary human islet cells to the hypoimmune HLA class I– and class II–negative and CD47-overexpressing phenotype and their reaggregation into human HIP pseudoislets (p-islets). Human HIP p-islets were shown to survive, engraft, and ameliorate diabetes in immunocompetent, allogeneic, diabetic humanized mice.

The survival and endocrine function of HIP p-islet cells were not impaired by contamination of unedited or partially edited cells within the p-islets. HIP p-islet cells were eliminated quickly and reliably in this model using a CD47-targeting antibody, thus providing a safety strategy in case HIP cells exert toxicity in a future clinical setting.

Human memory T cells include stem-like CD8+ memory T cell progenitors that can become either functional stem-like T (TSTEM) cells or dysfunctional T progenitor exhausted (TPEX) cells. To that end, we demonstrated that TSTEM cells were less abundant in infused CAR-T cell products in a phase 1 clinical trial testing Lewis Y-CAR-T cells (NCT03851146), and the infused CAR-T cells displayed poor persistence in patients. To address this issue, we developed a production protocol to generate TSTEM-like CAR-T cells enriched for expression of genes in cell replication pathways. Compared with conventional CAR-T cells, TSTEM-like CAR-T cells had enhanced proliferative capacity and increased cytokine secretion after CAR stimulation, including after chronic CAR stimulation in vitro. These responses were dependent on the presence of CD4+ T cells during TSTEM-like CAR-T cell production. Adoptive transfer of TSTEM-like CAR-T cells induced better control of established tumors and resistance to tumor rechallenge in preclinical models. These more favorable outcomes were associated with increased persistence of TSTEM-like CAR-T cells and an increased memory T cell pool. Last, TSTEM-like CAR-T cells and anti–programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) treatment eradicated established tumors, and this was associated with increased tumor-infiltrating CD8+CAR+ T cells producing interferon-γ.

Here, we evaluated 800 common p53 mutants for their rescue potencies by the representative generic rescue compound arsenic trioxide (ATO) in terms of transactivation activity, cell growth inhibition, and mouse tumor–suppressive activities. The rescue potencies were mainly determined by the solvent accessibility of the mutated residue, a key factor determining whether a mutation is a structural one, and the temperature sensitivity, the ability to reassemble the wild-type DNA binding surface at a low temperature, of the mutant protein. A total of 390 p53 mutants were rescued to varying degrees and thus were termed as type 1, type 2a, and type 2b mutations, depending on the degree to which they were rescued. The 33 type 1 mutations were rescued to amounts comparable to the wild type. In PDX mouse trials, ATO preferentially inhibited growth of tumors harboring type 1 and type 2a mutants. In an ATO clinical trial, we report the first-in-human mutant p53 reactivation in a patient harboring the type 1 V272M mutant.

However, severe myelosuppression and other toxicities after myeloablative conditioning regimens have hampered wider clinical use. To achieve donor hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) engraftment, it appears essential to establish niches for the donor HSCs by depleting the host HSCs. To date, this has been achievable only by nonselective treatments such as irradiation or chemotherapeutic drugs. An approach that is capable of more selectively depleting host HSCs is needed to widen the clinical application of HSCT. Here, we show in a clinically relevant nonhuman primate model that selective inhibition of B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) promoted hematopoietic chimerism and renal allograft tolerance after partial deletion of HSCs and effective peripheral lymphocyte deletion while preserving myeloid cells and regulatory T cells. Although Bcl-2 inhibition alone was insufficient to induce hematopoietic chimerism, the addition of a Bcl-2 inhibitor resulted in promotion of hematopoietic chimerism and renal allograft tolerance despite using only half of the dose of total body irradiation previously required. Selective inhibition of Bcl-2 is therefore a promising approach to induce hematopoietic chimerism without myelosuppression and has the potential to render HSCT more feasible for a variety of clinical indications.","2023-04-05","2024-05-27 00:00:15","2024-05-27 00:11:47","2024-05-27 00:00:14","eadd5318","","690","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/TM9JUHMH/Sasaki et al. - 2023 - Selective Bcl-2 inhibition promotes hematopoietic .pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Efforts to alleviate these complications remain at an impasse because of fundamentally conflicting design requirements: Millimeter-scale size is required to minimize invasiveness but exacerbates occlusion and malfunction. Here, we present a rational design strategy that reconciles these trade-offs in an implantable tube that is even smaller than the current standard of care. Using tympanostomy tubes (ear tubes) as an exemplary case, we developed an iterative screening algorithm and show how unique curved lumen geometries of the liquid-infused conduit can be designed to co-optimize drug delivery, effusion drainage, water resistance, and biocontamination/ingrowth prevention in a single subcapillary–length-scale device. Through extensive in vitro studies, we demonstrate that the engineered tubes enabled selective uni- and bidirectional fluid transport; nearly eliminated adhesion and growth of common pathogenic bacteria, blood, and cells; and prevented tissue ingrowth. The engineered tubes also enabled complete eardrum healing and hearing preservation and exhibited more efficient and rapid antibiotic delivery to the middle ear in healthy chinchillas compared with current tympanostomy tubes, without resulting in ototoxicity at up to 24 weeks. The design principle and optimization algorithm presented here may enable tubes to be customized for a wide range of patient needs.","2023-04-05","2024-05-27 00:00:40","2024-05-27 00:12:00","2024-05-27 00:00:40","eadd9779","","690","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/LSGCD5KS/Patel et al. - 2023 - Design of medical tympanostomy conduits with selec.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we used a chemogenetics strategy involving engineered designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) to activate a region of the marmoset brain that is dysfunctional in human patients with major depressive disorder, called the subcallosal anterior cingulate cortex area 25 (scACC-25). Using this DREADDs system, we identified separate scACC-25 neural circuits that underlie specific components of anhedonia and anxiety in marmosets. Activation of the neural pathway connecting the scACC-25 to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) caused blunting of anticipatory arousal (a form of anhedonia) in marmosets in response to a reward-associated conditioned stimulus in an appetitive Pavlovian discrimination test. Separately, activation of the circuit between the scACC-25 and the amygdala increased a measure of anxiety (the threat response score) when marmosets were presented with an uncertain threat (human intruder test). Using the anhedonia data, we then showed that the fast-acting antidepressant ketamine when infused into the NAc of marmosets prevented anhedonia after scACC-25 activation for more than 1 week.

We present an accurate classification approach to determine the CH status from cfDNA sequencing alone, applying our model to 4324 oncology clinical cfDNA samples. Using this method, we determined that 30.3% of patients in this cohort have evidence of CH, and the incidence of CH varies by tumor type. Matched RNA sequencing data show evidence of increased inflammation, especially neutrophil activation, within the tumors and tumor microenvironments of patients with CH. In addition, patients with CH had evidence of neutrophil activation systemically, pointing to a potential mechanism of action for the worse outcomes associated with CH status. Neutrophil activation may be one of many mechanisms, however, because patients with estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer harboring TET2 frameshift mutations had worse outcomes but similar neutrophil frequencies to patients without CH. Together, these data show the feasibility of detecting CH through cfDNA sequencing alone and an application of this method, demonstrating increased inflammation in patients with CH both systemically and in the tumor microenvironment.","2023-03-29","2024-05-27 00:00:42","2024-05-27 00:13:25","2024-05-27 00:00:42","eabm8729","","689","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/YVDFG2C5/Fairchild et al. - 2023 - Clonal hematopoiesis detection in patients with ca.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found that multivariate connectivity of the sensorimotor putamen was altered in humans with binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa and that the degree of alteration correlated with severity of disordered eating behavior. Furthermore, the extent of this circuit aberration correlated with mean diffusivity in the sensorimotor putamen and decreased basal dopamine D2/3 receptor binding potential in the striatum, consistent with previously reported microstructural changes and dopamine signaling mediating habit learning in animal models.

This demonstrates a need for improved therapy targeting this subgroup of B-ALL. Here, we show that the ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1) protein, a dioxygenase involved in DNA demethylation, is overexpressed and plays a crucial oncogenic role independent of its catalytic activity in B-ALL. Consistent with its oncogenic role in B-ALL, overexpression of TET1 alone in normal precursor B cells is sufficient to transform the cells and cause B-ALL in mice within 3 to 4 months. We found that TET1 protein is stabilized and overexpressed because of its phosphorylation mediated by protein kinase C epsilon (PRKCE) and ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM), which are also overexpressed in B-ALL. Mechanistically, TET1 recruits STAT5B to the promoters of CD72 and JCHAIN and promotes their transcription, which in turn promotes B-ALL development. Destabilization of TET1 protein by treatment with PKC or ATM inhibitors (staurosporine or AZD0156; both tested in clinical trials), or by pharmacological targeting of STAT5B, greatly decreases B-ALL cell viability and inhibits B-ALL progression in vitro and in vivo. The combination of AZD0156 with staurosporine or vincristine exhibits a synergistic effect on inhibition of refractory/relapsed B-ALL cell survival and leukemia progression in PDX models.

It is caused by mutations or epimutations affecting the expression or function of the maternally inherited allele of the ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene.

Reactivating the expression of the paternal UBE3A allele in the CNS has long been pursued as a therapeutic option for Angelman syndrome. Here, we described the development of an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy for Angelman syndrome that targets an evolutionarily conserved region demarcating the start of the UBE3A-AS transcript. We designed and chemically optimized gapmer ASOs targeting specific sequences at the start of the human UBE3A-AS transcript. We showed that ASOs targeting this region precisely and efficiently repress the transcription of UBE3A-AS, reactivating the expression of the paternal UBE3A allele in neurotypical and Angelman syndrome induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons. We further showed that human-targeted ASOs administered to the CNS of cynomolgus macaques by lumbar intrathecal injection repress UBE3A-AS and reactivate the expression of the paternal UBE3A allele throughout the CNS.

Here, we investigated the regenerative potential of clinically relevant human stromal cells from bone marrow (BMSCs), white adipose tissue, and umbilical cord compared with mature chondrocytes and skin fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo. Although all stromal cell types could express transcription factors related to endochondral ossification, only BMSCs formed cartilage discs in vitro that fully regenerated critical-size femoral defects after transplantation into mice. We identified cell type–specific epigenetic landscapes as the underlying molecular mechanism controlling transcriptional stromal differentiation networks. Binding sites of commonly expressed transcription factors in the enhancer and promoter regions of ossification-related genes, including Runt and bZIP families, were accessible only in BMSCs but not in extraskeletal stromal cells. This suggests an epigenetically predetermined differentiation potential depending on cell origin that allows common transcription factors to trigger distinct organ-specific transcriptional programs, facilitating forward selection of regeneration-competent cell sources. Last, we demonstrate that viable human BMSCs initiated defect healing through the secretion of osteopontin and contributed to transient mineralized bone hard callus formation after transplantation into immunodeficient mice, which was eventually replaced by murine recipient bone during final tissue remodeling.","2023-03-22","2024-05-27 00:00:49","2024-05-27 00:15:08","2024-05-27 00:00:49","eabm7477","","688","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/XPNV7HCK/Hochmann et al. - 2023 - The enhancer landscape predetermines the skeletal .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Via genetic and pharmacological experiments in vitro and in vivo, we demonstrated that a signaling tyrosine 814 (Y814) within gp130 serves as a major cellular stress sensor. Mice with constitutively inactivated Y814 (F814) were resistant to surgically induced osteoarthritis as reflected by reduced loss of proteoglycans, reduced synovitis, and synovial fibrosis. The F814 mice also exhibited enhanced regenerative, not reparative, responses after wounding in the skin. In addition, pharmacological modulation of gp130 Y814 upstream of the SRC and MAPK circuit by a small molecule, R805, elicited a protective effect on tissues after injury. Topical administration of R805 on mouse skin wounds resulted in enhanced hair follicle neogenesis and dermal regeneration. Intra-articular administration of R805 to rats after medial meniscal tear and to canines after arthroscopic meniscal release markedly mitigated the appearance of osteoarthritis. Single-cell sequencing data demonstrated that genetic and pharmacological modulation of Y814 resulted in attenuation of inflammatory gene signature as visualized by the anti-inflammatory macrophage and nonpathological fibroblast subpopulations in the skin and joint tissue after injury.

Many patients with ACM harbor mutations in desmosomal genes, predominantly in plakophilin-2 (PKP2). Although the genetic basis of ACM is well characterized, the underlying disease-driving mechanisms remain unresolved. Explanted hearts from patients with ACM had less PKP2 compared with healthy hearts, which correlated with reduced expression of desmosomal and adherens junction (AJ) proteins. These proteins were also disorganized in areas of fibrotic remodeling. In vitro data from human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes and microtissues carrying the heterozygous PKP2 c.2013delC pathogenic mutation also displayed impaired contractility. Knockin mice carrying the equivalent heterozygous Pkp2 c.1755delA mutation recapitulated changes in desmosomal and AJ proteins and displayed cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis with age. Global proteomics analysis of 4-month-old heterozygous Pkp2 c.1755delA hearts indicated involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in ACM pathogenesis. Inhibition of the UPS in mutant mice increased area composita proteins and improved calcium dynamics in isolated cardiomyocytes. Additional proteomics analyses identified lysine ubiquitination sites on the desmosomal proteins, which were more ubiquitinated in mutant mice. In summary, we show that a plakophilin-2 mutation can lead to decreased desmosomal and AJ protein expression through a UPS-dependent mechanism, which preceded cardiac remodeling.

A prototype example is the pancreatitis caused by asparaginase, a crucial drug used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here, we used a systems approach to identify the factors affecting asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (AAP). Connectivity Map analysis of the transcriptomic data showed that asparaginase-induced gene signatures were potentially reversed by retinoids (vitamin A and its analogs). Analysis of a large electronic health record database (TriNetX) and the U.S. Federal Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System demonstrated a reduction in AAP risk with concomitant exposure to vitamin A. Furthermore, we performed a global metabolomic screening of plasma samples from 24 individuals with ALL who developed pancreatitis (cases) and 26 individuals with ALL who did not develop pancreatitis (controls), before and after a single exposure to asparaginase. Screening from this discovery cohort revealed that plasma carotenoids were lower in the cases than in controls. This finding was validated in a larger external cohort. A 30-day dietary recall showed that the cases received less dietary vitamin A than the controls did. In mice, asparaginase administration alone was sufficient to reduce circulating and hepatic retinol. Based on these data, we propose that circulating retinoids protect against pancreatic inflammation and that asparaginase reduces circulating retinoids. Moreover, we show that AAP is more likely to develop with reduced dietary vitamin A intake. The systems approach taken for AAP provides an impetus to examine the role of dietary vitamin A supplementation in preventing or treating AAP.","2023-03-15","2024-05-27 00:00:54","2024-05-27 00:16:34","2024-05-27 00:00:54","eabn2110","","687","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/BX7UHRFY/Tsai et al. - 2023 - A systems approach points to a therapeutic role fo.pdf","","Others","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we found that presence of microbial-associated mannose structures at the surface of the kidney triggers the recognition of DC-SIGN–expressing γδ T cells, inducing a pathogenic interleukin-17a (IL-17a)–mediated autoimmune response. Mice lacking Mgat5, which have a higher abundance of mannose structures in the kidney, displayed increased γδ T cell infiltration into the kidney that was associated with spontaneous development of lupus in older mice. N-acetylglucosamine supplementation, which promoted biosynthesis of tolerogenic branched N-glycans in the kidney, was found to inhibit γδ T cell infiltration and control disease development.

Results from preclinical studies indicate the important role of arginine metabolism in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression, suggesting a potential for clinical application; however, divergent evolution in ARG1 expression and function in rodents and humans has restricted clinical translation. To overcome this dichotomy, here, we show that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), released by spontaneously activated neutrophils isolated from patients with PDAC, create a microdomain where cathepsin S (CTSS) cleaves human (h)ARG1 into different molecular forms endowed with enhanced enzymatic activity at physiological pH. NET-associated hARG1 suppresses T lymphocytes whose proliferation is restored by either adding a hARG1-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) or preventing CTSS-mediated cleavage, whereas small-molecule inhibitors are not effective. We show that ARG1 blockade, combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors, can restore CD8+ T cell function in ex vivo PDAC tumors. Furthermore, anti-hARG1 mAbs increase the frequency of adoptively transferred tumor-specific CD8+ T cells in tumor and enhance the effectiveness of immune checkpoint therapy in humanized mice. Thus, this study shows that extracellular ARG1, released by activated myeloid cells, localizes in NETs, where it interacts with CTSS that in turn cleaves ARG1, producing major molecular forms endowed with different enzymatic activity at physiological pH. Once exocytosed, ARG1 activity can be targeted by mAbs, which bear potential for clinical application for the treatment of PDAC and require further exploration.","2023-03-15","2024-05-27 00:02:38","2024-05-27 00:17:17","2024-05-27 00:02:38","eabq6221","","687","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/UDPUABVM/Canè et al. - 2023 - Neutralization of NET-associated human ARG1 enhanc.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mechanistically, we show that GM-CSF–producing T cells license monocyte-derived cells to produce matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12), which cleaves components of the glomerular basement membrane and exacerbates renal pathology.

Compounding this difficulty is the continued emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, where experimental strategies aiming to augment inflammatory responses for enhanced microbial killing are not applicable treatment options for infections of vulnerable organs. As with corneal infections, severe or prolonged inflammation jeopardizes corneal transparency, leading to devastating vision loss. We hypothesized that keratin 6a–derived antimicrobial peptides (KAMPs) may be a two-pronged remedy capable of tackling bacterial infection and inflammation at once. We used murine peritoneal neutrophils and macrophages, together with an in vivo model of sterile corneal inflammation, to find that nontoxic and prohealing KAMPs with natural 10– and 18–amino acid sequences suppressed lipoteichoic acid (LTA)– and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–induced NFκB and IRF3 activation, proinflammatory cytokine production, and phagocyte recruitment independently of their bactericidal function. Mechanistically, KAMPs not only competed with bacterial ligands for cell surface Toll-like receptor (TLR) and co-receptors (MD2, CD14, and TLR2) but also reduced cell surface availability of TLR2 and TLR4 through promotion of receptor endocytosis. Topical KAMP treatment effectively alleviated experimental bacterial keratitis, as evidenced by substantial reductions of corneal opacification, inflammatory cell infiltration, and bacterial burden. These findings reveal the TLR-targeting activities of KAMPs and demonstrate their therapeutic potential as a multifunctional drug for managing infectious inflammatory disease.","2023-03-08","2024-05-27 00:02:59","2024-05-27 00:26:17","2024-05-27 00:02:59","eade2909","","686","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/5CXHNFYH/Sun et al. - 2023 - Simultaneous control of infection and inflammation.pdf","","Log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although abatacept has been used to treat irAEs, it risks neutralizing the anti–cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibodies administered for cancer therapy, thereby reducing the efficacy of anti–CTLA-4 immunotherapy. To avoid this caveat, we compared wild-type abatacept and mutants of CTLA-4–Ig for their binding to clinically approved anti–CTLA-4 antibodies and for their effect on both irAEs and immunotherapy conferred by anti–CTLA-4 and anti–PD-1 antibodies.

Supplementation with COASY substrate (vitamin B5) rescued CoA and succinyl-CoA concentrations in SF3B1mut cells and mended erythropoiesis differentiation defects in MDS-RS primary patient cells. Our findings reveal a key role of the COASY pathway in erythroid maturation and identify upstream and downstream metabolites of COASY as a potential treatment for anemia in patients with MDS-RS.","2023-03","2024-05-27 00:03:02","2024-05-27 00:27:55","2024-05-27 00:03:02","eabn5135","","685","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/GMVZHXCU/Mian et al. - 2023 - Vitamin B5 and succinyl-CoA improve ineffective er.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies have shown that the hexanucleotide expansions cause the noncanonical translation of C9ORF72 transcripts into neurotoxic dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) that contribute to neurodegeneration. We show that a cell-penetrant peptide blocked the nuclear export of C9ORF72-repeat transcripts in HEK293T cells by competing with the interaction between SR-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) and nuclear export factor 1 (NXF1). The cell-penetrant peptide also blocked the translation of toxic DPRs in neurons differentiated from induced neural progenitor cells (iNPCs), which were derived from individuals carrying C9ORF72-linked ALS mutations. This peptide also increased survival of iNPC-differentiated C9ORF72-ALS motor neurons cocultured with astrocytes. Oral administration of the cell-penetrant peptide reduced DPR translation and rescued locomotor deficits in a Drosophila model of mutant C9ORF72-mediated ALS/FTD. Intrathecal injection of this peptide into the brains of ALS/FTD mice carrying a C9ORF72 mutation resulted in reduced expression of DPRs in mouse brains. These findings demonstrate that disrupting the production of DPRs in cellular and animal models of ALS/FTD might be a strategy to ameliorate neurodegeneration in these diseases.","2023-03","2024-05-27 00:03:03","2024-05-27 00:28:38","2024-05-27 00:03:03","eabo3823","","685","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/WKAWTRMK/Castelli et al. - 2023 - A cell-penetrant peptide blocking C9ORF72-repeat R.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also found that extraocular muscles (EOMs), which are spared by the disease in patients, contain muscle stem cells with long-lasting regenerative potential. Using single-cell transcriptomics analysis of muscles from a rat model of DMD, we identified the gene encoding thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (Tshr) as highly expressed in EOM stem cells. Further, TSHR activity was involved in preventing senescence. Forskolin, which activates signaling downstream of TSHR, was found to reduce senescence of skeletal muscle stem cells, increase stem cell regenerative potential, and promote myogenesis, thereby improving muscle function in DMD rats.

At 1 year, corresponding to human toddler age, we challenged vaccinated rhesus macaques and age-matched nonvaccinated controls intranasally and intratracheally with a high dose of heterologous SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta). Seven of eight control rhesus macaques exhibited severe interstitial pneumonia and high virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract.

Therefore, the development of a disease-modifying drug for endometriosis is an unmet medical need. By studying human endometriotic samples, we found that the progression of endometriosis was associated with the development of inflammation and fibrosis. In addition, IL-8 expression was highly up-regulated in endometriotic tissues and closely correlated with disease progression. We created a long-acting recycling antibody against IL-8 (AMY109) and evaluated its clinical potency. Because rodents do not produce IL-8 and do not experience menstruation, we analyzed the lesions in cynomolgus monkeys that spontaneously developed endometriosis and in a surgically induced endometriosis monkey model. Both spontaneously developed and surgically induced endometriotic lesions demonstrated pathophysiology that was highly similar to that of human endometriosis. Once-a-month subcutaneous injection of AMY109 to monkeys with surgically induced endometriosis reduced the volume of nodular lesions, lowered the Revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine score as modified for monkeys, and ameliorated fibrosis and adhesions. In addition, experiments using cells derived from human endometriosis revealed that AMY109 inhibited the recruitment of neutrophils to endometriotic lesions and the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 from neutrophils. Thus, AMY109 may represent a disease-modifying therapy for patients with endometriosis.","2023-02-22","2024-05-27 00:03:11","2024-05-27 00:28:49","2024-05-27 00:03:11","eabq5858","","684","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/VTQVQVEC/Nishimoto-Kakiuchi et al. - 2023 - A long-acting anti–IL-8 antibody improves inflamma.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether elevated BMI is a risk factor for women with a germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 is less clear because of inconsistent findings from epidemiological studies and a lack of mechanistic studies in this population. Here, we show that DNA damage in normal breast epithelia of women carrying a BRCA mutation is positively correlated with BMI and with biomarkers of metabolic dysfunction. In addition, RNA sequencing showed obesity-associated alterations to the breast adipose microenvironment of BRCA mutation carriers, including activation of estrogen biosynthesis, which affected neighboring breast epithelial cells. In breast tissue explants cultured from women carrying a BRCA mutation, we found that blockade of estrogen biosynthesis or estrogen receptor activity decreased DNA damage. Additional obesity-associated factors, including leptin and insulin, increased DNA damage in human BRCA heterozygous epithelial cells, and inhibiting the signaling of these factors with a leptin-neutralizing antibody or PI3K inhibitor, respectively, decreased DNA damage. Furthermore, we show that increased adiposity was associated with mammary gland DNA damage and increased penetrance of mammary tumors in Brca1+/− mice. Overall, our results provide mechanistic evidence in support of a link between elevated BMI and breast cancer development in BRCA mutation carriers.

Therefore, modulators of innate immune responses are expected to have high therapeutic potential across immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. IRAK4 is a kinase that integrates signaling downstream of receptors acting at the interface between innate and adaptive immune responses, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), interleukin-1R (IL-1R), and IL-18R. Because effects of IRAK4 inhibition are stimulus, cell type, and species dependent, the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of IRAK4 inhibitors requires a highly translational approach. Here, we profiled a selective IRAK4 inhibitor, GLPG2534, in an extensive panel of models of inflammatory skin diseases, translationally expanding evidence from in vitro to in vivo and from mouse to human. In vitro, IRAK4 inhibition resulted in substantial inhibition of TLR and IL-1 responses in dendritic cells, keratinocytes, granulocytes, and T cells but only weakly affected dermal fibroblast responses. Furthermore, disease activity in murine models of skin inflammation (IL-23–, IL-33–, imiquimod-, and MC903-induced) was markedly dampened by IRAK4 inhibition. Last, inhibiting IRAK4 reversed pathogenic molecular signatures in human lesional psoriasis and atopic dermatitis biopsies.

The vaccine can be produced in embryonated chicken eggs using the same process as that used for the production of the vast majority of influenza virus vaccines. Here, we performed a secondary analysis of the antibody responses after vaccination with inactivated NDV-HXP-S in a phase 1 clinical study in Thailand. The SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing and spike protein binding activity of NDV-HXP-S postvaccination serum samples was compared to that of samples from mRNA BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccinees. Neutralizing activity of sera from NDV-HXP-S vaccinees was comparable to that of BNT162b2 vaccinees, whereas spike protein binding activity of the NDV-HXP-S vaccinee samples was lower than that of sera obtained from mRNA vaccinees. This led us to calculate ratios between binding and neutralizing antibody titers. Samples from NDV-HXP-S vaccinees had binding to neutralizing activity ratios that were lower than those of BNT162b2 sera, suggesting that NDV-HXP-S vaccination elicits a high proportion of neutralizing antibodies and low non-neutralizing antibody titers. Further analysis showed that, in contrast to mRNA vaccination, which induces strong antibody titers to the receptor binding domain (RBD), the N-terminal domain, and the S2 domain, NDV-HXP-S vaccination induced an RBD-focused antibody response with little reactivity to S2. This finding may explain the high proportion of neutralizing antibodies. In conclusion, vaccination with inactivated NDV-HXP-S induces a high proportion of neutralizing antibodies and absolute neutralizing antibody titers that are comparable to those elicited by mRNA vaccination.","2023-02-15","2024-05-27 00:03:43","2024-05-27 00:31:58","2024-05-27 00:03:43","eabo2847","","683","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/WP2STEP9/Carreño et al. - 2023 - An inactivated NDV-HXP-S COVID-19 vaccine elicits .pdf","","Log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our functional screen of genetically probed macrophages with a chemical library identifies that TSN reverses macrophage-mediated tumor immunosuppression, leading to enhanced T cell infiltration, activation, and reduced exhaustion. Chemoproteomic and structural analyses revealed that TSN interacts with Hck and Lyn to abrogate suppressive macrophage immunity. In addition, a combination of immune checkpoint blockade and TSN therapy induced regression of syngeneic GBM tumors in mice. Furthermore, TSN treatment sensitized GBM to Egfrviii chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy.

To counteract these effects, multiple booster strategies were used in different countries, although data comparing their efficiency in improving protective immunity remain sparse, especially among vulnerable populations, including older adults. The inactivated CoronaVac vaccine was among the most widely distributed vaccine worldwide and was essential in the early control of SARS-CoV-2–related hospitalizations and deaths. However, it is not well understood whether homologous versus heterologous booster doses in those fully vaccinated with CoronaVac induce distinct humoral responses or whether these responses vary across age groups. We analyzed plasma antibody responses from CoronaVac-vaccinated younger or older individuals who received a homologous CoronaVac or heterologous BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 booster vaccine. All three evaluated boosters resulted in increased virus-specific IgG titers 28 days after the booster dose. However, we found that both IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2 Spike or RBD and neutralization titers against Omicron sublineages were substantially reduced in participants who received homologous CoronaVac compared with the heterologous BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 booster. This effect was specifically prominent in recipients >50 years of age. In this group, the CoronaVac booster induced low virus-specific IgG titers and failed to elevate neutralization titers against any Omicron sublineage.

Preservation duration beyond 4 hours is associated with primary graft dysfunction (PGD). Given transport time constraints, geographical limitations exist for donor-recipient matching, leading to donor heart underutilization. Here, we showed that metabolic reprogramming through up-regulation of the enzyme immune response gene 1 (IRG1) and its product itaconate improved heart function after prolonged preservation. Irg1 transcript induction was achieved by adding the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) to a histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution used for donor heart preservation. VPA increased acetylated H3K27 occupancy at the IRG1 enhancer and IRG1 transcript expression in human donor hearts. IRG1 converts aconitate to itaconate, which has both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Accordingly, our studies showed that Irg1 transcript up-regulation by VPA treatment increased nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) in mice, which was accompanied by increased antioxidant protein expression [hemeoxygenase 1 (HO1) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)]. Deletion of Irg1 in mice (Irg1−/−) negated the antioxidant and cardioprotective effects of VPA. Consistent with itaconate’s ability to inhibit succinate dehydrogenase, VPA treatment of human hearts increased itaconate availability and reduced succinate accumulation during preservation. VPA similarly increased IRG1 expression in pig donor hearts and improved its function in an ex vivo cardiac perfusion system both at the clinical 4-hour preservation threshold and at 10 hours. These results suggest that augmentation of cardioprotective immune-metabolomic pathways may be a promising therapeutic strategy for improving donor heart function in transplantation.","2023-02-08","2024-05-27 00:03:56","2024-05-27 00:33:21","2024-05-27 00:03:56","eade3782","","682","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/DNZYB7MY/Lei et al. - 2023 - Metabolic reprogramming by immune-responsive gene .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chronic exposure to SU lowered Cyb5r3 abundance and reduced islet glucose utilization in mice in vivo and in ex vivo murine islets. Cyb5r3 β cell–specific knockout mice phenocopied SU failure. Cyb5r3 engaged in a glucose-dependent interaction that stabilizes glucokinase (Gck) to maintain glucose utilization. Hence, Gck activators can circumvent Cyb5r3-dependent SU failure.

Despite successful therapies including antibodies against tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, only 20 to 30% of patients experience remission. We studied whether inhibiting both TNF and IL-6 would result in improved efficacy. Using backtranslation from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from individuals with RA, we hypothesized that TNF and IL-6 act synergistically on fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and T cells. Coculture of FLS from individuals with RA and T cells supported this hypothesis, revealing effects on both disease-driving pathways and biomarkers. Combining anti-TNF and anti–IL-6 antibodies in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse models resulted in sustained long-term remission, improved histology, and effects on bone remodeling pathways. These promising data initiated the development of an anti–TNF/IL-6 bispecific nanobody compound 1, with similar potencies against TNF and IL-6. We observed additive efficacy of compound 1 in a FLS/T cell coculture affecting arthritis and T helper 17 (TH17) pathways. This nanobody compound transcript signature inversely overlapped with described RA endotypes, indicating a potential efficacy in a broader patient population.

The presence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) in these patients led to the initial hypothesis that immune complexes could be key mediators. Although the formation of ADAs and immune complexes may be a prerequisite, other factors likely contribute to some patients having RV/RO, whereas the vast majority do not. To identify and characterize the mechanistic drivers underlying the immunogenicity of brolucizumab and the consequence of subsequent ADA-induced immune complex formation, a translational approach was performed to bridge physicochemical characterization, structural modeling, sequence analysis, immunological assays, and a quantitative systems pharmacology model that mimics physiological conditions within the eye. This approach revealed that multiple factors contributed to the increased immunogenic potential of brolucizumab, including a linear epitope shared with bacteria, non-natural surfaces due to the single-chain variable fragment format, and non-native drug species that may form over prolonged time in the eye. Consideration of intraocular drug pharmacology and disease state in a quantitative systems pharmacology model suggested that immune complexes could form at immunologically relevant concentrations modulated by dose intensity. Assays using circulating immune cells from treated patients or treatment-naïve healthy volunteers revealed the capacity of immune complexes to trigger cellular responses such as enhanced antigen presentation, platelet aggregation, endothelial cell activation, and cytokine release. Together, these studies informed a mechanistic understanding of the clinically observed immunogenicity of brolucizumab and associated cases of RV/RO.","2023-02","2024-05-27 00:04:00","2024-05-27 00:35:05","2024-05-27 00:04:00","eabq5068","","681","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/XDW7IY72/Kearns et al. - 2023 - A root cause analysis to identify the mechanistic .pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In 2020, rare cases of retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion (RV/RO) were reported, often during the first few months after treatment initiation, consistent with a possible immunologic pathobiology. This finding was inconsistent with preclinical studies in cynomolgus monkeys that demonstrated no drug-related intraocular inflammation, or RV/RO, despite the presence of preexisting and treatment-emergent antidrug antibodies (ADAs) in some animals. In this study, the immune response against brolucizumab in humans was assessed using samples from clinical trials and clinical practice. In the brolucizumab-naïve population, anti-brolucizumab ADA responses were detected before any treatment, which was supported by the finding that healthy donors can harbor brolucizumab-specific B cells. This suggested prior exposure of the immune system to proteins with structural similarity. Experiments on samples showed that naïve and brolucizumab-treated ADA-positive patients developed a class-switched, high-affinity immune response, with several linear epitopes being recognized by ADAs. Only patients with RV/RO showed a meaningful T cell response upon recall with brolucizumab. Further studies in cynomolgus monkeys preimmunized against brolucizumab with adjuvant followed by intravitreal brolucizumab challenge demonstrated that high ADA titers were required to generate ocular inflammation and vasculitis/vascular thrombosis, comparable to RV/RO in humans. Immunogenicity therefore seems to be a prerequisite to develop RV/RO.

Although tumor evolution can be shaped by immunoediting toward a less immunogenic phenotype, mechanisms governing the initial immunogenicity of primordial tumor cells or original cancer stem cells remain obscure. Here, using a single tumor-repopulating cell (TRC) to form tumors in immunodeficient or immunocompetent mice, we demonstrated that immunogenic heterogeneity is an inherent trait of tumorigenic cells defined by the activation status of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) protein in the absence of immune pressure. Subsequent investigation identified that the RNA binding protein cold shock domain–containing protein E1 (CSDE1) can promote STAT1 dephosphorylation by stabilizing T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP). A methyltransferase SET and MYN domain–containing 3 (SMYD3) was further identified to mediate H3K4 trimethylation of CSDE1 locus, which was under the regulation of mechanotransduction by cell-matrix and cell-cell contacts. Thus, owing to the differential epigenetic modification and subsequent differential expression of CSDE1, nascent tumorigenic cells may exhibit either a high or low immunogenicity.

To address this, we performed a correlative study in which we collected and analyzed peripheral blood of patients with glioblastoma (n = 20) receiving chemoradiotherapy using genomic and immune monitoring technologies. RNA sequencing analysis of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) showed an elevated concentration of myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) regulatory genes in patients with lymphopenia when compared with patients without lymphopenia after chemoradiotherapy. Additional analysis including flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing further confirmed increased numbers of circulating MDSC in patients with lymphopenia when compared with patients without lymphopenia after chemoradiotherapy. Preclinical murine models were also established and demonstrated a causal relationship between radiation-induced MDSC and systemic lymphopenia using transfusion and depletion experiments. Pharmacological inhibition of MDSC using an arginase-1 inhibitor (CB1158) or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (tadalafil) during radiation therapy (RT) successfully abrogated radiation-induced lymphopenia and improved survival in the preclinical models.

Even in heterozygous carriers, this missense variant leads to a severe loss of ALDH2 enzymatic activity and has been linked to an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction plays a determining role in all stages of CAD pathogenesis, including early-onset CAD. However, the contribution of ALDH2*2 to EC dysfunction and its relation to CAD are not fully understood. In a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) from Biobank Japan, ALDH2*2 was found to be one of the strongest single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with CAD. Clinical assessment of endothelial function showed that human participants carrying ALDH2*2 exhibited impaired vasodilation after light alcohol drinking. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived ECs (iPSC-ECs) and CRISPR-Cas9–corrected ALDH2*2 iPSC-ECs, we modeled ALDH2*2-induced EC dysfunction in vitro, demonstrating an increase in oxidative stress and inflammatory markers and a decrease in nitric oxide (NO) production and tube formation capacity, which was further exacerbated by ethanol exposure. We subsequently found that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) such as empagliflozin mitigated ALDH2*2-associated EC dysfunction. Studies in ALDH2*2 knock-in mice further demonstrated that empagliflozin attenuated ALDH2*2-mediated vascular dysfunction in vivo. Mechanistically, empagliflozin inhibited Na+/H+-exchanger 1 (NHE-1) and activated AKT kinase and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) pathways to ameliorate ALDH2*2-induced EC dysfunction.

Animal models of PD suggest that activation of Abelson tyrosine kinase (c-Abl) plays an essential role in the initiation and progression of α-synuclein pathology and initiates processes leading to degeneration of dopaminergic and nondopaminergic neurons. Given the potential role of c-Abl in PD, a c-Abl inhibitor library was developed to identify orally bioavailable c-Abl inhibitors capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier based on predefined characteristics, leading to the discovery of IkT-148009. IkT-148009, a brain-penetrant c-Abl inhibitor with a favorable toxicology profile, was analyzed for therapeutic potential in animal models of slowly progressive, α-synuclein–dependent PD. In mouse models of both inherited and sporadic PD, IkT-148009 suppressed c-Abl activation to baseline and substantially protected dopaminergic neurons from degeneration when administered therapeutically by once daily oral gavage beginning 4 weeks after disease initiation.

Here, we report that YTX-7739, a clinical-stage inhibitor of stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD), triggers lipotoxicity in patient-derived GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) and inhibits fatty acid desaturation in GSCs orthotopically implanted in mice. When administered as a single agent, or in combination with temozolomide (TMZ), YTX-7739 showed therapeutic efficacy in orthotopic GSC mouse models owing to its lipotoxicity and ability to impair DNA damage repair. Leveraging genetic, pharmacological, and physiological manipulation of key signaling nodes in gliomagenesis complemented with shotgun lipidomics, we show that aberrant MEK/ERK signaling and its repression of the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) primarily drive therapeutic vulnerability to SCD and other DNLS inhibitors. Conversely, AMPK activation mitigates lipotoxicity and renders GSCs resistant to the loss of DNLS, both in culture and in vivo, by decreasing the saturation state of phospholipids and diverting toxic lipids into lipid droplets.

Pyroptosis is a gasdermin-driven lytic programmed cell death triggered by inflammatory caspases when initiated by canonical or noncanonical pathways that has been recently seen as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment. However, overcoming chemoresistance in cancers by modulating pyroptosis has not been explored. Here, we demonstrate that β5-integrin represses chemotherapy-induced canonical pyroptosis to confer cancer chemoresistance through ASAH2-driven sphingolipid metabolic reprogramming. Clinically, high β5-integrin expression associates with poor patient prognosis and chemotherapeutic responses in cancers. In addition, chemoresistant cells in vitro fail to undergo chemotherapy-induced pyroptosis, which is controlled by β5-integrin. Mechanistically, proteomic and lipidomic analyses indicate that β5-integrin up-regulates sphingolipid metabolic enzyme ceramidase (ASAH2) expression through Src–signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, which then reduces the metabolite ceramide concentration and subsequent ROS production to prohibit chemotherapy-induced canonical pyroptosis. Using cancer cell lines, patient-derived tumor organoids, and orthotopic lung and pancreatic animal models, we show that administration of a Src or ceramidase inhibitor rescues the response of chemoresistant pancreatic and lung cancer cells to chemotherapy by reactivating pyroptosis in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our results suggest that pyroptosis-based therapy is a means to improve cancer treatment and warrants further investigation.","2023-01-11","2024-05-27 00:04:44","2024-05-27 00:39:22","2024-05-27 00:04:44","eabl7895","","678","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/73HSWNW9/Su et al. - 2023 - Targeting Src reactivates pyroptosis to reverse ch.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We performed genome-wide analysis of cfDNA from 521 samples and analyzed sequencing data from an additional 2147 samples, including healthy individuals and patients with 11 different cancer types. We developed a metric based on genome-wide differences in fragment positioning, weighted by fragment length and GC content [information-weighted fraction of aberrant fragments (iwFAF)]. We observed that iwFAF strongly correlated with tumor fraction, was higher for DNA fragments carrying somatic mutations, and was higher within genomic regions affected by copy number amplifications. We also calculated sample-level means of nucleotide frequencies observed at genomic positions spanning fragment ends. Using a combination of iwFAF and nine nucleotide frequencies from three positions surrounding fragment ends, we developed a machine learning model to differentiate healthy individuals from patients with cancer. We observed an area under the receiver operative characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91 for detection of cancer at any stage and an AUC of 0.87 for detection of stage I cancer.

The lack of appropriate neutralizing antibodies recognizing IL-2RG has made it difficult to thoroughly interrogate the role of γc cytokines in inflammatory and autoimmune disease settings. Here, we generated a γc cytokine receptor antibody, REGN7257, to determine whether γc cytokines might be targeted for T cell–mediated disease prevention and treatment. Biochemical, structural, and in vitro analysis showed that REGN7257 binds with high affinity to IL-2RG and potently blocks signaling of all γc cytokines. In nonhuman primates, REGN7257 efficiently suppressed T cells without affecting granulocytes, platelets, or red blood cells. Using REGN7257, we showed that γc cytokines drive T cell–mediated disease in mouse models of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and multiple sclerosis by affecting multiple aspects of the pathogenic response. We found that our xenogeneic GVHD mouse model recapitulates hallmarks of acute and chronic GVHD, with T cell expansion/infiltration into tissues and liver fibrosis, as well as hallmarks of immune aplastic anemia, with bone marrow aplasia and peripheral cytopenia. Our findings indicate that γc cytokines contribute to GVHD and aplastic anemia pathology by promoting these characteristic features. By demonstrating that broad inhibition of γc cytokine signaling with REGN7257 protects from immune-mediated disorders, our data provide evidence of γc cytokines as key drivers of pathogenic T cell responses, offering a potential strategy for the management of T cell–mediated diseases.","2023-01-11","2024-05-27 00:04:48","2024-05-27 00:39:42","2024-05-27 00:04:48","eabo0205","","678","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/3WJJGZUJ/Le Floc’h et al. - 2023 - Blocking common γ chain cytokine signaling amelior.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Viral replication was thus dependent on the autocatalytic processing of this precursor protein by 3CLpro and release of the functional viral proteins G and L, and replication of this chimeric VSV was effectively inhibited by nirmatrelvir. Using this system, we applied nirmatrelvir to select for resistance mutations. Resistance was confirmed by retesting nirmatrelvir against the selected mutations in additional VSV-based systems, in an independently developed cellular system, in a biochemical assay, and in a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 system.

Here, we used our platform to screen 1009 human plasma samples for 3600 autoantibody-antigen complexes, finding that plasma from patients with SCLC harbors, on average, fourfold higher disease-specific autoantibody signals compared with plasma from patients with other cancers. Across three independent SCLC cohorts, we identified a set of common but previously unknown autoantibodies that are produced in response to both intracellular and extracellular tumor antigens. We further characterized several disease-specific posttranslational modifications within extracellular proteins targeted by these autoantibodies, including citrullination, isoaspartylation, and cancer-specific glycosylation. Because most patients with SCLC have metastatic disease at diagnosis, we queried whether these autoantibodies could be used for SCLC early detection. We created a risk prediction model using five autoantibodies with an average area under the curve of 0.84 for the three cohorts that improved to 0.96 by incorporating cigarette smoke consumption in pack years.

How researchers can anticipate the evolutionary trajectory of the virus in advance in the design of next-generation vaccines requires investigation. Here, we performed a comprehensive study of 11,650,487 SARS-CoV-2 sequences, which revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein evolved not randomly but into directional paths of either high infectivity plus low immune resistance or low infectivity plus high immune resistance. The viral infectivity and immune resistance of variants are generally incompatible, except for limited variants such as Beta and Kappa. The Omicron variant has the highest immune resistance but showed high infectivity in only one of the tested cell lines. To provide cross-clade immunity against variants that undergo diverse evolutionary pathways, we designed a new pan-vaccine antigen (Span). Span was designed by analyzing the homology of 2675 SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequences from the NCBI database before the Delta variant emerged. The refined Span protein harbors high-frequency residues at given positions that reflect cross-clade generality in sequence evolution. Compared with a prototype wild-type (Swt) vaccine, which, when administered to mice, induced serum with decreased neutralization activity against emerging variants, Span vaccination of mice elicited broad immunity to a wide range of variants, including those that emerged after our design.

Unlike inactivated tumor cells, living tumor cells have the ability to track and target tumors. Here, we developed a bifunctional whole cancer cell–based therapeutic with direct tumor killing and immunostimulatory roles. We repurposed the tumor cells from interferon-β (IFN-β) sensitive to resistant using CRISPR-Cas9 by knocking out the IFN-β–specific receptor and subsequently engineered them to release immunomodulatory agents IFN-β and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. These engineered therapeutic tumor cells (ThTCs) eliminated established glioblastoma tumors in mice by inducing caspase-mediated cancer cell apoptosis, down-regulating cancer-associated fibroblast-expressed platelet-derived growth factor receptor β, and activating antitumor immune cell trafficking and antigen-specific T cell activation signaling. This mechanism-based efficacy of ThTCs translated into a survival benefit and long-term immunity in primary, recurrent, and metastatic cancer models in immunocompetent and humanized mice. The incorporation of a double kill-switch comprising herpes simplex virus–1 thymidine kinase and rapamycin-activated caspase 9 in ThTCs ensured the safety of our approach. Arming naturally neoantigen-rich tumor cells with bifunctional therapeutics represents a promising cell-based immunotherapy for solid tumors and establishes a road map toward clinical translation.","2023-01-04","2024-05-27 00:05:11","2024-05-27 00:41:03","2024-05-27 00:05:11","eabo4778","","677","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/3YH4MABZ/Chen et al. - 2023 - Bifunctional cancer cell–based vaccine concomitant.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RAF-MAP2K signaling plays a key role in axon elongation during nervous system development. Here, we show that conditional expression of a constitutively kinase-activated BRAF in mature corticospinal neurons elicited the expression of a set of transcription factors previously implicated in the regeneration of zebrafish retinal ganglion cell axons and promoted regeneration and sprouting of corticospinal tract (CST) axons after spinal cord injury in mice. Newly sprouting axon collaterals formed synaptic connections with spinal interneurons, resulting in improved recovery of motor function. Noninvasive suprathreshold high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) activated the BRAF canonical downstream effectors MAP2K1/2 and modulated the expression of a set of regeneration-related transcription factors in a pattern consistent with that induced by BRAF activation. HF-rTMS enabled CST axon regeneration and sprouting, which was abolished in MAP2K1/2 conditional null mice. These data collectively demonstrate a central role of MAP2K signaling in augmenting the growth capacity of mature corticospinal neurons and suggest that HF-rTMS might have potential for treating spinal cord injury by modulating MAP2K signaling.","2023-01-04","2024-05-27 00:05:13","2024-05-27 00:41:41","2024-05-27 00:05:13","eabq6885","","677","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/BWIRKWXD/Boato et al. - 2023 - Activation of MAP2K signaling by genetic engineeri.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we show that a decrease in the activity of the serotonin transporter (SERT) accelerates MV remodeling and progression to MR. Through studies of a population of patients with MR, we show that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use and SERT promoter polymorphism 5-HTTLPR LL genotype were associated with MV surgery at younger age. Functional characterization of 122 human MV samples, in conjunction with in vivo studies in SERT−/− mice and wild-type mice treated with the SSRI fluoxetine, showed that diminished SERT activity in MV interstitial cells (MVICs) contributed to the pathophysiology of MR through enhanced serotonin receptor (HTR) signaling. SERT activity was decreased in LL MVICs partially because of diminished membrane localization of SERT. In mice, fluoxetine treatment or SERT knockdown resulted in thickened MV leaflets. Similarly, silencing of SERT in normal human MVICs led to up-regulation of transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) and collagen (COL1A1) in the presence of serotonin. In addition, treatment of MVICs with fluoxetine not only directly inhibited SERT activity but also decreased SERT expression and increased HTR2B expression. Fluoxetine treatment and LL genotype were also associated with increased COL1A1 expression in the presence of serotonin in MVICs, and these effects were attenuated by HTR2B inhibition. These results suggest that assessment of both 5-HTTLPR genotype and SERT-inhibiting treatments may be useful tools to risk-stratify patients with MV disease to estimate the likelihood of rapid disease progression.","2023-01-04","2024-05-27 00:05:14","2024-05-27 00:41:26","2024-05-27 00:05:14","eadc9606","","677","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/9YXUMPIF/Castillero et al. - 2023 - Decreased serotonin transporter activity in the mi.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To identify antifibrotic drug targets, we integrated progressive transcriptomic and morphological responses that accompany HSC activation in advanced disease using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and tissue clearing in a robust murine NASH model. In advanced fibrosis, we found that an autocrine HSC signaling circuit emerged that was composed of 68 receptor-ligand interactions conserved between murine and human NASH. These predicted interactions were supported by the parallel appearance of markedly increased direct stellate cell-cell contacts in murine NASH. As proof of principle, pharmacological inhibition of one such autocrine interaction, neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 3–neurotrophin 3, inhibited human HSC activation in culture and reversed advanced murine NASH fibrosis. In summary, we uncovered a repertoire of antifibrotic drug targets underlying advanced fibrosis in vivo. The findings suggest a therapeutic paradigm in which stage-specific therapies could yield enhanced antifibrotic efficacy in patients with advanced hepatic fibrosis.","2023-01-04","2024-05-27 00:05:15","2024-05-27 00:40:45","2024-05-27 00:05:15","eadd3949","","677","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ZZEXBMY9/Wang et al. - 2023 - An autocrine signaling circuit in hepatic stellate.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
