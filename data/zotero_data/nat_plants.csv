The light regulation of transcription and protein stability of nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins have been extensively studied, but how light regulation of mRNA metabolism affects abundance of nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins and chlorophyll homeostasis remains poorly understood.

In contrast to the CRY2-mediated photo-condensation of the mRNA adenosine methylase (MTA), photoexcited CRY2 co-condenses FIO1 only in the presence of the CRY2-signalling protein SUPPRESSOR of PHYTOCHROME A (SPA1). CRY2 and SPA1 synergistically or additively activate the RNA methyltransferase activity of FIO1 in vitro, whereas CRY2 and FIO1, but not MTA, are required for the light-induced methylation and translation of the mRNAs encoding multiple chlorophyll homeostasis regulators in vivo. Our study demonstrates that the light-induced liquid–liquid phase separation of the photoreceptor/writer complexes is commonly involved in the regulation of photoresponsive changes of mRNA methylation, whereas the different photo-condensation mechanisms of the CRY/FIO1 and CRY/MTA complexes explain, at least partially, the writer-specific functions in plant photomorphogenesis.","2023-12-08","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-03-15 01:51:30","2042-2058","","12","9","","Nat.

Recent studies reported the characterization of a divergent family of Brassicaceae-specific peptides, SERINE RICH ENDOGENOUS PEPTIDES (SCOOPs), and their perception by the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase MALE DISCOVERER 1-INTERACTING RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 2 (MIK2). Here, we reveal that the SCOOP family is highly expanded, containing at least 50 members in the Columbia-0 reference Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Notably, perception of these peptides is strictly MIK2-dependent. How bioactive SCOOP peptides are produced, and to what extent their perception is responsible for the multiple physiological roles associated with MIK2 are currently unclear. Using N-terminomics, we validate the N-terminal cleavage site of representative PROSCOOPs. The cleavage sites are determined by conserved motifs upstream of the minimal SCOOP bioactive epitope. We identified subtilases necessary and sufficient to process PROSCOOP peptides at conserved cleavage motifs. Mutation of these subtilases, or their recognition motifs, suppressed PROSCOOP cleavage and associated overexpression phenotypes. Furthermore, we show that higher-order mutants of these subtilases show phenotypes reminiscent of mik2 null mutant plants, consistent with impaired PROSCOOP biogenesis, and demonstrating biological relevance of SCOOP perception by MIK2. Together, this work provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of the recently identified SCOOP peptides and their receptor MIK2.","2023-12","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:37:45","2085-2094","","12","9","","Nat.

Recent fire in California damaged coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) groves, consuming all foliage on some of the tallest and oldest trees on Earth. Burned trees recovered through resprouting from roots, trunk and branches, necessarily supported by nonstructural carbon reserves. Nonstructural carbon reserves can be many years old, but direct use of old carbon has rarely been documented and never in such large, old trees. We found some sprouts contained the oldest carbon ever observed to be remobilized for growth. For certain trees, simulations estimate up to half of sprout carbon was acquired in photosynthesis more than 57 years prior, and direct observations in sapwood show trees can access reserves at least as old. Sprouts also emerged from ancient buds—dormant under bark for centuries. For organisms with millennial lifespans, traits enabling survival of infrequent but catastrophic events may represent an important energy sink. Remobilization of decades-old photosynthate after disturbance demonstrates substantial amounts of nonstructural carbon within ancient trees cycles on slow, multidecadal timescales.","2023-12","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:37:45","1978-1985","","12","9","","Nat.

Here we generated a chromosome-scale genome assembly of the Asian pitcher plant Nepenthes gracilis to analyse how its novel traits (dioecy and carnivorous pitcher leaves) are linked to genomic evolution. We found a decaploid karyotype and a clear indication of subgenome dominance. A male-linked and pericentromerically located region on the putative sex chromosome was identified in a recessive subgenome and was found to harbour three transcription factors involved in flower and pollen development, including a likely neofunctionalized LEAFY duplicate. Transcriptomic and syntenic analyses of carnivory-related genes suggested that the paleopolyploidization events seeded genes that subsequently formed tandem clusters in recessive subgenomes with specific expression in the digestive zone of the pitcher, where specialized cells digest prey and absorb derived nutrients. A genome-scale analysis suggested that subgenome dominance likely contributed to evolutionary innovation by permitting recessive subgenomes to diversify functions of novel tissue-specific duplicates.

Here we show that the Arabidopsis phytosulfokine receptor 1 (pskr1) mutant displays autoimmunity (plant stunting, defence-gene expression and reduced rhizosphere bacterial growth) in response to growth-promoting Pseudomonas fluorescens. Microbiome profiling and microbiota colonization showed that PSKR1-mediated reduction in bacterial growth and stunting is largely specific to Pseudomonas. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated that PSKR1 regulates the growth–defence trade-off during Pseudomonas colonization: PSKR1 upregulates plant photosynthesis and root growth but suppresses salicylic-acid-mediated defences. Genetic epistasis experiments showed that pskr1 stunting and restriction of bacterial growth are salicylic acid dependent. Finally, we showed that Pseudomonas, but not other bacteria, induces PSKR1 expression in roots, suggesting that Pseudomonas might manipulate plant signalling to promote its colonization. Our data demonstrate a genetic mechanism to coordinate beneficial functions of the microbiome while preventing autoimmunity.","2023-12","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:37:45","2071-2084","","12","9","","Nat.

Beyond the ancestral form of RNase P containing a ribozyme, protein-only RNase P enzymes termed PRORP were identified in eukaryotes. In human mitochondria, PRORP forms a complex with two protein partners to become functional. In plants, although PRORP enzymes are active alone, we investigate their interaction network to identify potential tRNA maturation complexes. Here we investigate functional interactions involving the Arabidopsis nuclear RNase P PRORP2. We show, using an immuno-affinity strategy, that PRORP2 occurs in a complex with the tRNA methyl transferases TRM1A and TRM1B in vivo. Beyond RNase P, these enzymes can also interact with RNase Z. We show that TRM1A/TRM1B localize in the nucleus and find that their double knockout mutation results in a severe macroscopic phenotype. Using a combination of immuno-detections, mass spectrometry and a transcriptome-wide tRNA sequencing approach, we observe that TRM1A/TRM1B are responsible for the m22G26 modification of 70% of cytosolic tRNAs in vivo. We use the transcriptome wide tRNAseq approach as well as RNA blot hybridizations to show that RNase P activity is impaired in TRM1A/TRM1B mutants for specific tRNAs, in particular, tRNAs containing a m22G modification at position 26 that are strongly downregulated in TRM1A/TRM1B mutants. Altogether, results indicate that the m22G-adding enzymes TRM1A/TRM1B functionally cooperate with nuclear RNase P in vivo for the early steps of cytosolic tRNA biogenesis.","2023-12","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:37:45","2031-2041","","12","9","","Nat.

While early-diverging SLY1s display relatively broad-range DELLA affinity, later-diverging SLY1s tend towards increasingly stringent affinity for a specific DELLA A’ form generated by the growth-promoting phytohormone gibberellin (GA). Our novel mutational strategy reveals amino acid substitutions contributing to the evolution of Arabidopsis thaliana SLY1 A’ specificity, also showing that routes permitting reversion to broader affinity became increasingly constrained over evolutionary time.

Informative cells from shoot and root tissues were grouped into 48 different cell clusters and finely annotated using multiple markers. With the determination of comprehensive developmental trajectories, we demonstrate light modulation of cell fate determination during guard cell specialization and vasculature development. Comparison of expression atlases between wild type and the pifq mutant indicates that phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs) are involved in distinct developmental processes in endodermal and stomatal lineage cells via controlling cell-type-specific expression of target genes. These results provide information concerning the light signalling networks at the cell-type resolution, improving our understanding of how light regulates plant development at the cell-type and genome-wide levels.

The SOS1 forms a dimeric architecture, with an NhaA-folded transmembrane domain portion in the membrane and an elongated cytosolic portion of multiple regulatory domains in the cytoplasm. The structural comparison shows that SOS1 adopts an elevator transport mechanism accompanied by a conformational transition of the highly conserved Pro148 in the unwound transmembrane helix 5 (TM5), switching from an occluded conformation in the auto-inhibited state to a conducting conformation in the active state.

Yet our understanding of the factors influencing forest leaf types remains incomplete, leaving us uncertain about the global proportions of needle-leaved, broadleaved, evergreen and deciduous trees. To address these gaps, we conducted a global, ground-sourced assessment of forest leaf-type variation by integrating forest inventory data with comprehensive leaf form (broadleaf vs needle-leaf) and habit (evergreen vs deciduous) records. We found that global variation in leaf habit is primarily driven by isothermality and soil characteristics, while leaf form is predominantly driven by temperature. Given these relationships, we estimate that 38% of global tree individuals are needle-leaved evergreen, 29% are broadleaved evergreen, 27% are broadleaved deciduous and 5% are needle-leaved deciduous. The aboveground biomass distribution among these tree types is approximately 21% (126.4 Gt), 54% (335.7 Gt), 22% (136.2 Gt) and 3% (18.7 Gt), respectively. We further project that, depending on future emissions pathways, 17–34% of forested areas will experience climate conditions by the end of the century that currently support a different forest type, highlighting the intensification of climatic stress on existing forests. By quantifying the distribution of tree leaf types and their corresponding biomass, and identifying regions where climate change will exert greatest pressure on current leaf types, our results can help improve predictions of future terrestrial ecosystem functioning and carbon cycling.","2023-11","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:37:45","1795-1809","","11","9","","Nat.

Its conserved role is based on the induction of actin polymerization at the interface between membranes and the cytoplasm. Plant ARP2/3 has been reported to participate in actin reorganization at the plasma membrane during polarized growth of trichomes and at the plasma membrane–endoplasmic reticulum contact sites. Here we demonstrate that individual plant subunits of ARP2/3 fused to fluorescent proteins form motile spot-like structures in the cytoplasm that are associated with peroxisomes in Arabidopsis and tobacco. ARP2/3 is found at the peroxisome periphery and contains the assembled ARP2/3 complex and the WAVE/SCAR complex subunit NAP1. This ARP2/3-positive peroxisomal domain colocalizes with the autophagosome and, under conditions that affect the autophagy, colocalization between ARP2/3 and the autophagosome increases. ARP2/3 subunits co-immunoprecipitate with ATG8f and peroxisome-associated ARP2/3 interact in vivo with the ATG8f marker. Since mutants lacking functional ARP2/3 complex have more peroxisomes than wild type, we suggest that ARP2/3 has a novel role in the process of peroxisome degradation by autophagy, called pexophagy.","2023-11","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:37:45","1874-1889","","11","9","","Nat.

Here we developed a split deaminase for safe editing (SAFE) system applicable to BEs containing distinct cytidine or adenosine deaminases, with no need of external regulators. In SAFE, a BE was properly split at a deaminase domain embedded inside a Cas9 nickase, simultaneously fragmenting and deactivating both the deaminase and the Cas9 nickase. The gRNA-conditioned BE reassembly conferred robust on-target editing in plant, human and yeast cells, while minimizing both gRNA-independent and gRNA-dependent off-target DNA/RNA edits. SAFE also substantially increased product purity by eliminating indels.

Therefore, improving N-responsive reshaping of RSA for optimal N absorption is a major target for developing crops with high NUE. In this study, we identified RNR10 (REGULATOR OF N-RESPONSIVE RSA ON CHROMOSOME 10) as the causal gene that underlies the significantly different root developmental plasticity in response to changes in N level exhibited by the indica (Xian) and japonica (Geng) subspecies of rice. RNR10 encodes an F-box protein that interacts with a negative regulator of auxin biosynthesis, DNR1 (DULL NITROGEN RESPONSE1). Interestingly, RNR10 monoubiquitinates DNR1 and inhibits its degradation, thus antagonizing auxin accumulation, which results in reduced root responsivity to N and nitrate (NO3−) uptake. Therefore, modulating the RNR10-DNR1-auxin module provides a novel strategy for coordinating a desirable RSA and enhanced N acquisition for future sustainable agriculture.","2023-11","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:37:45","1902-1914","","11","9","","Nat.

A progressive reduction of genetic diversity accompanied this process. Genes controlling circadian clock/flowering and carotenoid accumulation were under selection during domestication and improvement. Three recessive genes, at the REC, Or and Y2 quantitative trait loci, were essential to select for the high α- and β-carotene orange phenotype. All three genes control high α- and β-carotene accumulation through molecular mechanisms that regulate the interactions between the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, the photosynthetic system and chloroplast biogenesis. Overall, this study elucidated carrot domestication and breeding history and carotenoid genetics at a molecular level.","2023-10","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:37:45","1643-1658","","10","9","","Nat.

Here, we applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing to characterize the roots of Medicago truncatula at 30 min, 6 h and 24 h after nod factor treatment. We found drastic global gene expression reprogramming at 30 min in the epidermis and cortex and most of these changes were restored at 6 h. Moreover, plant defence response genes are activated at 30 min and subsequently suppressed at 6 h in non-meristem cells. Only in the cortical cells but not in other cell types, we found the flavonoid synthase genes required to recruit rhizobia are highly expressed 30 min after inoculation with nod factors. A gene module enriched for symbiotic nitrogen fixation genes showed that MtFER (MtFERONIA) and LYK3 (LysM domain receptor-like kinase 3) share similar responses to symbiotic signals.

To provide new insights into the biology of parasitic plants in general, we assembled genomes for members of the sandalwood order Santalales, including a stem hemiparasite (Scurrula) and two highly modified root holoparasites (Balanophora) that possess chimaeric host–parasite tubers. Comprehensive genome comparisons reveal that hemiparasitic Scurrula has experienced a relatively minor degree of gene loss compared with autotrophic plants, consistent with its moderate degree of parasitism. Nonetheless, patterns of gene loss appear to be substantially divergent across distantly related lineages of hemiparasites. In contrast, Balanophora has experienced substantial gene loss for the same sets of genes as an independently evolved holoparasite lineage, the endoparasitic Sapria (Malpighiales), and the two holoparasite lineages experienced convergent contraction of large gene families through loss of paralogues. This unprecedented convergence supports the idea that despite their extreme and strikingly divergent life histories and morphology, the evolution of these and other holoparasitic lineages can be shaped by highly predictable modes of genome reduction. We observe substantial evidence of relaxed selection in retained genes for both hemi- and holoparasitic species.

These gravitropic setpoint angles are intriguing because their maintenance requires that roots are able to effect growth response both with and against the gravity vector, a phenomenon previously attributed to gravitropism acting against an antigravitropic offset mechanism. Here we show how the components mediating gravitropism in the vertical primary root—PINs and phosphatases acting upon them—are reconfigured in their regulation such that lateral root growth at a range of angles can be maintained. We show that the ability of Arabidopsis lateral roots to bend both downward and upward requires the generation of auxin asymmetries and is driven by angle-dependent variation in downward gravitropic auxin flux acting against angle-independent upward, antigravitropic flux. Further, we demonstrate a symmetry in auxin distribution in lateral roots at gravitropic setpoint angle that can be traced back to a net, balanced polarization of PIN3 and PIN7 auxin transporters in the columella. These auxin fluxes are shifted by altering PIN protein phosphoregulation in the columella, either by introducing PIN3 phosphovariant versions or via manipulation of levels of the phosphatase subunit PP2A/RCN1. Finally, we show that auxin, in addition to driving lateral root directional growth, acts within the lateral root columella to induce more vertical growth by increasing RCN1 levels, causing a downward shift in PIN3 localization, thereby diminishing the magnitude of the upward, antigravitropic auxin flux.","2023-09","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:37:45","1500-1513","","9","9","","Nat.

Structural and biochemical analyses reveal that the ABA bound with ABCG25 adopts a similar configuration as that in ABA receptors and that the ABA-specific binding is dictated by residues from transmembrane helices TM1, TM2 and TM5a of each protomer at the transmembrane domain interface. Comparison of different conformational structures reveals conformational changes, especially those of transmembrane helices and residues constituting the substrate translocation pathway during the cross-membrane transport process.

The cellular level of ABA is critical to its signalling and is determined by its rate of biosynthesis, catabolism and the rates of ABA transport. ABCG25 in Arabidopsis thaliana has been identified to be an ABA exporter and play roles in regulating stomatal closure and seed germination. However, its ABA transport mechanism remains unknown. Here we report the structures of ABCG25 under different states using cryo-electron microscopy single particle analysis: the apo state and ABA-bound state of the wild-type ABCG25 and the ATP-bound state of the ATPase catalytic mutant. ABCG25 forms a homodimer. ABA binds to a cone-shaped, cytosolic-facing cavity formed in the middle of the transmembrane domains. Key residues in ABA binding are identified and verified by a cell-based ABA transport assay. ATP binding leads to closing of the nucleotide-binding domains of opposing monomers and conformational transitions of the transmembrane domains. Together, these results provide insights into the substrate recognition and transport mechanisms of ABCG25 in Arabidopsis, and facilitate our understanding of the ABA transport and signalling pathway in plants.","2023-10","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:37:46","1697-1708","","10","9","","Nat.

However, previous efforts have mostly targeted the major constituents of woody biomass: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Here we report the engineering of wood structure through the introduction of callose, a polysaccharide novel to most secondary cell walls. Our multiscale analysis of genetically engineered poplar trees shows that callose deposition modulates cell wall porosity, water and lignin contents and increases the lignin–cellulose distance, ultimately resulting in substantially decreased biomass recalcitrance. We provide a model of the wood cell wall nano-architecture engineered to accommodate the hydrated callose inclusions. Ectopic polymer introduction into biomass manifests in new physico-chemical properties and offers new avenues when considering lignocellulose engineering.","2023-09","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:37:46","1530-1546","","9","9","","Nat.

In this study, we developed a microbe-induced gene silencing (MIGS) technology by using a rhizospheric beneficial fungus, Trichoderma harzianum, to exploit an RNAi engineering microbe and two soil-borne pathogenic fungi, Verticillium dahliae and Fusarium oxysporum, as RNAi recipients. We first detected the feasibility of MIGS in inducing GFP silencing in V. dahliae. Then by targeting a fungal essential gene, we further demonstrated the effectiveness of MIGS in inhibiting fungal growth and protecting dicotyledon cotton and monocotyledon rice plants against V. dahliae and F. oxysporum. We also showed steerable MIGS specificity based on a selected target sequence. Our data verify interspecies RNAi in rhizospheric fungi and the potential application of MIGS in crop protection.

Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of LHCII in membrane nanodiscs, which mimic in vivo LHCII, and in detergent solution at pH 7.8 and 5.4, respectively. We found that, under low pH conditions, the salt bridges at the lumenal side of LHCII are broken, accompanied by the formation of two local α-helices on the lumen side. The formation of α-helices in turn triggers allosterically global protein conformational change, resulting in a smaller crossing angle between transmembrane helices.

The GAPLESS proteins are specifically localized in the CS of root endodermal cells, and loss of their functions results in a disabled cell–cell junction and disrupted nutrient homoeostasis. The GAPLESS protein forms a tight complex with OsCASP1 in the plasma membrane, thereby mediating the CS–CSD junction.

PAs, including salicylic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid and so on, directly bind RBP47B, promote its phase separation and trigger SG formation accompanied by global translation inhibition. Salicylic acid-induced global translation inhibition depends on RBP47 family members. RBP47s regulate the proteome rather than the absolute quantity of SG. The rbp47 quadruple mutant shows a reduced sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of the PA mixture as well as to that of PA-rich rice when tested in a co-culturing ecosystem.

ASL localizes to plastids and its expression is induced by ammonium. ASL alleviates ammonium-inhibited root elongation by converting the excessive glutamine to arginine. Consequently, arginine leads to auxin accumulation in the root meristem, thereby stimulating root elongation under high ammonium.

Axenic plants exhibited hypersusceptibility to infection by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Microbiota-mediated immunocompetence was suppressed by rich nutrient conditions, indicating a tripartite interaction between the host, microbiota and abiotic environment.

Here we report that Arabidopsis IRE1 determines cell fate in ER stress by balancing the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and UPR through the plant-unique E3 ligase, PHOSPHATASE TYPE 2CA (PP2CA)-INTERACTING RING FINGER PROTEIN 1 (PIR1). Indeed, PIR1 loss leads to suppression of pro-death UPS and the lethal phenotype of an IRE1 loss-of-function mutant in unresolved ER stress in addition to activating pro-survival UPR. Specifically, in ER stress, PIR1 loss stabilizes ABI5, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, that directly activates expression of the critical UPR regulator gene, bZIP60, triggering transcriptional cascades enhancing pro-survival UPR. Collectively, our results identify new cell fate effectors in plant ER stress by showing that IRE1’s coordination of cell death and survival hinges on PIR1, a key pro-death component of the UPS, which controls ABI5, a pro-survival transcriptional activator of bZIP60.","2023-08","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:37:46","1333-1346","","8","9","","Nat.

These studies also indicate that LoVIL1 is a suitable marker for the bud-growth-transition trait following dormancy release in lily cultivars.","2023-09","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:38:48","1451-1467","","9","9","","Nat.

How these inputs intersect to promote growth and development remains poorly understood. During reproductive development, central zone stem cell proliferation in inflorescence meristems is negatively regulated by the CLAVATA3 (CLV3) peptide signalling pathway. In contrast, floral primordia formation on meristem flanks requires the hormone auxin. Here we show that CLV3 signalling is also necessary for auxin-dependent floral primordia generation and that this function is partially masked by both inflorescence fasciation and heat-induced auxin biosynthesis. Stem cell regulation by CLAVATA signalling is separable from primordia formation but is also sensitized to temperature and auxin levels. In addition, we uncover a novel role for the CLV3 receptor CLAVATA1 in auxin-dependent meristem maintenance in cooler environments. As such, CLV3 signalling buffers multiple auxin-dependent shoot processes across divergent thermal environments, with opposing effects on cell proliferation in different meristem regions.","2023-08","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:38:48","1306-1317","","8","9","","Nat.

Our knowledge of the structure of green plant PSII supercomplex is based on findings obtained from several representatives of green algae and flowering plants; however, data from a non-flowering plant are currently missing. Here we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of PSII supercomplex from spruce, a representative of non-flowering land plants, at 2.8 Å resolution. Compared with flowering plants, PSII supercomplex in spruce contains an additional Ycf12 subunit, Lhcb4 protein is replaced by Lhcb8, and trimeric LHCII is present as a homotrimer of Lhcb1. Unexpectedly, we have found α-tocopherol (α-Toc)/α-tocopherolquinone (α-TQ) at the boundary between the LHCII trimer and the inner antenna CP43. The molecule of α-Toc/α-TQ is located close to chlorophyll a614 of one of the Lhcb1 proteins and its chromanol/quinone head is exposed to the thylakoid lumen. The position of α-Toc in PSII supercomplex makes it an ideal candidate for the sensor of excessive light, as α-Toc can be oxidized to α-TQ by high-light-induced singlet oxygen at low lumenal pH. The molecule of α-TQ appears to shift slightly into the PSII supercomplex, which could trigger important structure–functional modifications in PSII supercomplex. Inspection of the previously reported cryo-electron microscopy maps of PSII supercomplexes indicates that α-Toc/α-TQ can be present at the same site also in PSII supercomplexes from flowering plants, but its identification in the previous studies has been hindered by insufficient resolution.","2023-08","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:38:48","1359-1369","","8","9","","Nat.

We have previously reported that the B3 domain transcriptional repressor SOD7 (NGAL2) and its closest homologue DPA4 (NGAL3) act redundantly to limit organ and seed growth in Arabidopsis. Here we report that SOD7 represses the interaction between the transcriptional coactivator GRF-INTERACTING FACTOR 1 (GIF1) and growth-regulating factors (GRFs) by competitively interacting with GIF1, thereby limiting organ and seed growth. We further reveal that GIF1 physically interacts with FER-LIKE IRON DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (FIT), which acts as a central regulator of iron uptake and homeostasis. SOD7 can competitively repress the interaction of GIF1 with FIT to influence iron uptake and responses. The sod7-2 dpa4-3 mutant enhances the expression of genes involved in iron uptake and displays high iron accumulation. Genetic analyses support that GIF1 functions downstream of SOD7 to regulate organ and seed growth as well as iron uptake and responses. Thus, our findings define a previously unrecognized mechanism that the SOD7/DPA4–GIF1 module coordinates organ growth and iron uptake by targeting key regulators of growth and iron uptake.","2023-08","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:38:48","1318-1332","","8","9","","Nat.

However, the molecular mechanism of DELLA-mediated transcription reprogramming remains unclear. Here by characterizing new missense alleles of an Arabidopsis DELLA, repressor of ga1-3 (RGA), and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we show that RGA binds histone H2A via the PFYRE subdomain within its GRAS domain to form a TF–RGA–H2A complex at the target chromatin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing analysis further shows that this activity is essential for RGA association with its target chromatin globally. Our results indicate that, although DELLAs are recruited to target promoters by binding to TFs via the LHR1 subdomain, DELLA–H2A interaction via the PFYRE subdomain is necessary to stabilize the TF–DELLA–H2A complex at the target chromatin.

Perennial weed species are particularly troublesome. Such perennials as Sorghum halepense spread quickly and are difficult to manage due to their ability to reproduce sexually via seeds and asexually through rhizomes. Our theoretical study of S. halepense incorporates this complex life cycle with control measures of herbicide application and tillage. Rooted in the biology and experimental data of S. halepense, our population-based model predicts population dynamics and target-site resistance evolution in this perennial weed. We found that the resistance cost determines the standing genetic variation for herbicide resistance. The sexual phase of the life cycle, including self-pollination and seed bank dynamics, contributes substantially to the persistence and rapid adaptation of S. halepense. While self-pollination accelerates target-site resistance evolution, seed banks considerably increase the probability of escape from control strategies and maintain genetic variation. Combining tillage and herbicide application effectively reduces weed densities and the risk of control failure without delaying resistance adaptation. We also show how mixtures of different herbicide classes are superior to rotations and mono-treatment in controlling perennial weeds and resistance evolution. Thus, by integrating experimental data and agronomic views, our theoretical study synergistically contributes to understanding and tackling the global threat to food security from resistant weeds.","2023-08","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:38:48","1267-1279","","8","9","","Nat.

Two west-to-east (trans-Pacific) colonization events support the key role of the North Pacific Current.

P. patens possesses at least three types of PSI with different antenna sizes. The largest PSI form (PpPSI-L) exhibits a unique organization found neither in flowering plants nor in algae. Its formation is mediated by the P. patens-specific LHC protein, Lhcb9.

Our structural analysis established the essential role of Lhcb9 and the phosphorylated LHCII in stabilizing the complex.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, nuclear matrix constituent proteins (NMCPs) are essential components of the nuclear lamina and are required to maintain the structural integrity of the nucleus and specific perinuclear chromatin anchoring. At the nuclear periphery, suppressed chromatin overlapping with repetitive sequences and inactive protein-coding genes are enriched. At a chromosomal level, plant chromatin organization in interphase nuclei is flexible and responds to various developmental cues and environmental stimuli. On the basis of these observations in Arabidopsis, and given the role of NMCP genes (CRWN1 and CRWN4) in organizing chromatin positioning at the nuclear periphery, one can expect considerable changes in chromatin–nuclear lamina interactions when the global chromatin organization patterns are being altered in plants. Here we report the highly flexible nature of the plant nuclear lamina, which disassembles substantially under various stress conditions. Focusing on heat stress, we reveal that chromatin domains, initially tethered to the nuclear envelope, remain largely associated with CRWN1 and become scattered in the inner nuclear space. By investigating the three-dimensional chromatin contact network, we further reveal that CRWN1 proteins play a structural role in shaping the changes in genome folding under heat stress. Also, CRWN1 acts as a negative transcriptional coregulator to modulate the shift of the plant transcriptome profile in response to heat stress.","2023-07","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:38:48","1081-1093","","7","9","","Nat.

If the evolution of masting represents a balance between these benefits and costs, we expect mast avoidance in species that are heavily reliant on mutualist dispersers. These effects play out in the context of variable climate and site fertility among species that vary widely in nutrient demand. Meta-analyses of published data have focused on variation at the population scale, thus omitting periodicity within trees and synchronicity between trees. From raw data on 12 million tree-years worldwide, we quantified three components of masting that have not previously been analysed together: (i) volatility, defined as the frequency-weighted year-to-year variation; (ii) periodicity, representing the lag between high-seed years; and (iii) synchronicity, indicating the tree-to-tree correlation. Results show that mast avoidance (low volatility and low synchronicity) by species dependent on mutualist dispersers explains more variation than any other effect. Nutrient-demanding species have low volatility, and species that are most common on nutrient-rich and warm/wet sites exhibit short periods. The prevalence of masting in cold/dry sites coincides with climatic conditions where dependence on vertebrate dispersers is less common than in the wet tropics. Mutualist dispersers neutralize the benefits of masting for predator satiation, further balancing the effects of climate, site fertility and nutrient demands.","2023-07","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:38:48","1044-1056","","7","9","","Nat.

There are controversies regarding the glucan chain number (N) of CMFs during initial synthesis and whether they become fused afterward. Here, we combined small-angle X-ray scattering, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray diffraction analyses to resolve CMF nanostructures in native wood. We developed small-angle X-ray scattering measurement methods for the cross-section aspect ratio and area of the crystalline-ordered CMF core, which has a higher scattering length density than the semidisordered shell zone. The 1:1 aspect ratio suggested that CMFs remain mostly segregated, not fused. The area measurement reflected the chain number in the core zone (Ncore). To measure the ratio of ordered cellulose over total cellulose (Roc) by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, we developed a method termed global iterative fitting of T1ρ-edited decay (GIFTED), in addition to the conventional proton spin relaxation editing method. Using the formula N = Ncore/Roc, most wood CMFs were found to contain 24 glucan chains, conserved between gymnosperm and angiosperm trees. The average CMF has a crystalline-ordered core of ~2.2 nm diameter and a semidisordered shell of ~0.5 nm thickness. In naturally and artificially aged wood, we observed only CMF aggregation (contact without crystalline continuity) but not fusion (forming a conjoined crystalline unit). This further argued against the existence of partially fused CMFs in new wood, overturning the recently proposed 18-chain fusion hypothesis. Our findings are important for advancing wood structural knowledge and more efficient use of wood resources in sustainable bio-economies.","2023-07","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:38:48","1154-1168","","7","9","","Nat.

By using species distribution modelling and a dated phylogeny, we predict widespread reductions in species’ range sizes that will result in increases in seagrass weighted and phylogenetic endemism. These projected increases of endemism will result in divergent shifts in the spatial composition of β-diversity leading to differentiation in some areas and the homogenization of seagrass communities in other regions. Regardless of the climate scenario, the potential hotspots of these projected shifts in seagrass α- and β-diversity are predicted to occur outside the current network of marine protected areas, providing new priority areas for future conservation planning that incorporate seagrasses.

Here we examined PSFs among nine annual and nine perennial grassland species to test whether poorly defended annuals accumulate generalist-dominated plant antagonist communities, causing equally negative PSFs on conspecific and heterospecific annuals, whereas well-defended perennial species accumulate specialist-dominated antagonist communities, predominantly causing negative conspecific PSFs. Annuals exhibited more negative PSFs than perennials, corresponding to differences in root–tissue investments, but this was independent of conditioning plant group. Overall, conspecific and heterospecific PSFs did not differ. Instead, conspecific and heterospecific PSF responses in individual species’ soils were correlated.

Three structurally divergent domains were identified relative to the red-type bacterial Rhodobacter sphaeroides RsRubisco that, unlike GmRubisco, are expressed in Escherichia coli and plants. Kinetic comparison of 11 RsRubisco chimaeras revealed that incorporating C329A and A332V substitutions from GmRubisco Loop 6 (corresponding to plant residues 328 and 331) into RsRubisco increased the carboxylation rate (kcatc) by 60%, the carboxylation efficiency in air by 22% and the CO2/O2 specificity (Sc/o) by 7%.

Further studies established that MdSnRK2.3, whose expression could be regulated by expressing MdERDL6-1, could interact with and phosphorylate MdAREB1.1/1.2, thereby promoting the MdAREB1.1/1.2-mediated transcriptional activation of MdTST1/2. Finally, the orthologous SlAREB1.2 and SlSnRK2.3 exhibited similar functions in tomato fruit as in their apple counterparts. Together, our findings provide insights into the regulatory mechanism of tonoplast sugar transport exerted by SnRK2.3-AREB1-TST1/2 for fruit sugar accumulation.","2023-06","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:38:48","951-964","","6","9","","Nat.

To better understand these contrasts, we solved, by cryo-electron microscopy, the three-dimensional structure of full-length PhyA as Pr. Like PhyB, PhyA dimerizes through head-to-head assembly of its C-terminal histidine kinase-related domains (HKRDs), while the remainder assembles as a head-to-tail light-responsive platform. Whereas the platform and HKRDs associate asymmetrically in PhyB dimers, these lopsided connections are absent in PhyA.

Fusion between a transport vesicle and its target membrane transforms the trans- into a cis-SNARE complex. The latter interacts with the hexameric AAA+-ATPase N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and its co-factor alpha-soluble NSF attachment protein (αSNAP), forming a 20S complex2,3. ATPase activity disassembles the SNAP receptor (SNARE) complex into Qa-SNARE, which folds back onto itself, and its partners4,5. The fusion of identical membranes has a different sequence of events6. The fusion partners each have cis-SNARE complexes to be broken up by NSF and αSNAP. The Qa-SNARE monomers are then stabilized by interaction with Sec1/Munc18-type regulators (SM proteins) to form trans-SNARE complexes, as shown for the yeast vacuole7. Membrane fusion in Arabidopsis cytokinesis is formally akin to vacuolar fusion8. Membrane vesicles fuse with one another to form the partitioning membrane known as the cell plate. Cis-SNARE complexes of cytokinesis-specific Qa-SNARE KNOLLE and its SNARE partners are assembled at the endoplasmic reticulum and delivered by traffic via the Golgi/trans-Golgi network to the cell division plane9. The SM protein KEULE is required for the formation of trans-SNARE complexes between adjacent membrane vesicles10. Here we identify NSF and its adaptor αSNAP2 as necessary for the disassembly of KNOLLE cis-SNARE complexes, which is a prerequisite for KNOLLE–KEULE interaction in cytokinesis. In addition, we show that NSF is required for other trafficking pathways and interacts with the respective Q-SNAREs. The SNARE complex disassembly machinery is conserved in plants and plays a unique essential role in cytokinesis.","2023-06","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:38:49","889-897","","6","9","","Nat.

We show that this is promoted by the activity of redundant bHLH-type transcription factors from two distinct clades and coactivated by homeodomain factors.

Additionally, sink organs such as fruits, cereals and seeds that accumulate high concentrations of sugar also depend on this active transport of sucrose. Here we present the structure of the sucrose–proton symporter, Arabidopsis thaliana SUC1, in an outward open conformation at 2.7 Å resolution, together with molecular dynamics simulations and biochemical characterization. We identify the key acidic residue required for proton-driven sucrose uptake and describe how protonation and sucrose binding are strongly coupled. Sucrose binding is a two-step process, with initial recognition mediated by the glucosyl moiety binding directly to the key acidic residue in a stringent pH-dependent manner. Our results explain how low-affinity sucrose transport is achieved in plants, and pinpoint a range of SUC binders that help define selectivity. Our data demonstrate a new mode for proton-driven symport with links to cation-driven symport and provide a broad model for general low-affinity transport in highly enriched substrate environments.","2023-06","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:38:49","938-950","","6","9","","Nat.

We found that species with greater potential height, smaller leaf size and diverse human utilization attributes had the highest probability of long-term persistence. The persistence probabilities of human-associated species (taxa with diverse human utilization attributes) were relatively high in intensively cultivated areas. Conversely, the persistence probabilities of spontaneous species (taxa with no human utilization attributes and which are not cultivated) were relatively high in mountainous areas or regions inhabited by ethnic minorities. The distinctly different geographic patterns of persistence probabilities of the two groups of species were related to their dissimilar responses to heterogeneous human activities and site conditions.

At maturity, the grass leaf is a flattened, strap-like organ comprising a proximal supportive sheath surrounding the stem and a distal photosynthetic blade. The sheath and blade are partitioned by a hinge-like auricle and the ligule, a fringe of epidermally derived tissue that grows from the adaxial (top) leaf surface. Together, the ligule and auricle comprise morphological novelties that are specific to grass leaves. Understanding how the planar outgrowth of grass leaves and their adjoining ligules is genetically controlled can yield insight into their evolutionary origins. Here we use single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses to identify a ‘rim’ cell type present at the margins of maize leaf primordia. Cells in the leaf rim have a distinctive identity and share transcriptional signatures with proliferating ligule cells, suggesting that a shared developmental genetic programme patterns both leaves and ligules. Moreover, we show that rim function is regulated by genetically redundant Wuschel-like homeobox3 (WOX3) transcription factors. Higher-order mutations in maize Wox3 genes greatly reduce leaf width and disrupt ligule outgrowth and patterning.

In ARK mutants of the moss Physcomitrium patens, the anterograde motility of nuclei, chloroplasts, mitochondria and secretory vesicles was suppressed. Ectopic expression of non-motile or tail-deleted ARK did not restore organelle distribution. Another prominent macroscopic phenotype of ARK mutants was the suppression of cell tip growth. We showed that this defect was attributed to the mislocalization of actin regulators, including RopGEFs; expression and forced apical localization of RopGEF3 partially rescued the growth phenotype of the ARK mutant.

Here we report a non-canonical function of ATG8 in regulating the restoration of plant Golgi damaged by HS. Short-term acute HS causes vacuolation of the Golgi apparatus and translocation of ATG8 to the dilated Golgi membrane. The inactivation of the ATG conjugation system, but not of the upstream autophagic initiators, abolishes the targeting of ATG8 to the swollen Golgi, causing a delay in Golgi recovery after HS. Using TurboID-based proximity labelling, we identified CLATHRIN LIGHT CHAIN 2 (CLC2) as an interacting partner of ATG8 via the AIM–LDS interface. CLC2 is recruited to the cisternal membrane by ATG8 to facilitate Golgi reassembly.

The application of auxin to unpollinated ovaries can also induce parthenocarpy (seedless fruit production). Previous studies have shown that auxin signalling components SlIAA9 and SlARF7 (a class A AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF)) are key repressors of fruit initiation in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). A similar repressive role of class A ARFs in fruit set has also been observed in other plant species. However, evidence is lacking for a role of any class A ARF in promoting fruit development as predicted in the current auxin signalling model. Here we generated higher-order tomato mutants of four class A SlARFs (SlARF5, SlARF7, SlARF8A and SlARF8B) and uncovered their precise combinatorial roles that lead to suppressing and promoting fruit development. All four class A SlARFs together with SlIAA9 inhibited fruit initiation but promoted subsequent fruit growth. Transgenic tomato lines expressing truncated SlARF8A/8B lacking the IAA9-interacting PB1 domain displayed strong parthenocarpy, further confirming the promoting role of SlARF8A/8B in fruit growth. Altering the doses of these four SlARFs led to biphasic fruit growth responses, showing their versatile dual roles as both negative and positive regulators. RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation–quantitative PCR analyses further identified SlARF8A/8B target genes, including those encoding MADS-BOX transcription factors (AG1, MADS2 and AGL6) that are key repressors of fruit set. These results support the idea that SlIAA9/SlARFs directly regulate the transcription of these MADS-BOX genes to inhibit fruit set. Our study reveals the previously unknown dual function of four class A SlARFs in tomato fruit development and illuminates the complex combinatorial effects of multiple ARFs in controlling auxin-mediated fruit set and fruit growth.","2023-05","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:38:49","706-719","","5","9","","Nat.

We then apply CAPE for promoter editing of OsD18, a gene encoding GA3ox in the gibberellin biosynthesis pathway. The resulting lines carry a QTV continuum of semidwarfism without significantly compromising grain measures. Field trials demonstrated that the OsD18 promoter editing lines have the same yield performance and antilodging phenotype as the Green Revolution OsSD1 mutants in different genetic backgrounds. Hence, promoter editing of OsD18 generates a quantitative Green Revolution trait.

A promising approach for developing haploid inducers is by manipulating centromere-specific histone H3 (CENH3/CENPA)1. GFP-tailswap, a CENH3-based inducer, induces paternal haploids at around 30% and maternal haploids at around 5% (ref. 2). However, male sterility of GFP-tailswap makes high-demand maternal haploid induction more challenging. Our study describes a simple and highly effective method for improving both directions of haploid production. Lower temperatures dramatically enhance pollen vigour but reduce haploid induction efficiency, while higher temperatures act oppositely. Importantly, the effects of temperatures on pollen vigour and on haploid induction efficiency are independent. These features enable us to easily induce maternal haploids at around 24.8% by using pollen of inducers grown at lower temperatures to pollinate target plants, followed by switching to high temperatures for haploid induction. Moreover, paternal haploid induction can be simplified and enhanced by growing the inducer at higher temperatures pre- and post-pollination. Our findings provide new clues for developing and using CENH3-based haploid inducers in crops.","2023-05","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:39:41","699-705","","5","9","","Nat.

Further analysis indicates that phosphorylation of phyB by FER is sufficient to accelerate the conversion of phyB from the active form (Pfr) to the inactive form (Pr). Under salt stress, FER kinase activity is inhibited, leading to delayed photobody dissociation and increased phyB protein abundance in the nucleus. Our data also show that phyB mutation or overexpression of PIF5 attenuates growth inhibition and promotes plant survival under salt stress.

As a result, xylem-side stem cell daughter preferentially differentiates into xylem, while phloem-side daughter retains stem cell identity. Occasionally, this broadening leads to direct specification of both daughters as xylem, and consequently, adjacent phloem-identity cell reverts to being stem cell.

By analysing whole-genome sequences of 795 wheat accessions, we found that bread wheat originated from the southwest coast of the Caspian Sea and underwent a slow speciation process, lasting ~3,300 yr owing to persistent gene flow from its relatives. Soon after, bread wheat spread across Eurasia and reached Europe, South Asia and East Asia ~7,000 to ~5,000 yr ago, shaping a diversified but occasionally convergent adaptive landscape in novel environments. By contrast, the cultivated relatives of bread wheat experienced a population decline by ~82% over the past ~2,000 yr due to the food choice shift of humans. Further biogeographical modelling predicted a continued population shrinking of many bread wheat relatives in the coming decades because of their vulnerability to the changing climate. These findings will guide future efforts in protecting and utilizing wheat biodiversity to enhance global wheat production.","2023-03","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:39:42","403-419","","3","9","","Nat.

We confirmed biome edges to be strong delineators of distributions. Importantly, we identified a stronger contribution of temperate than tropical biomes to range edges, adding strength to the notion that tropical areas are centres of radiation. We subsequently identified a strong association of range-edge hotspots with steep spatial climatic gradients.

Here we identify and characterize a plant-specific GCN5-containing complex, which we term PAGA, in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. In Arabidopsis, the PAGA complex consists of two conserved subunits (GCN5 and ADA2A) and four plant-specific subunits (SPC, ING1, SDRL and EAF6). We find that PAGA and SAGA can independently mediate moderate and high levels of histone acetylation, respectively, thereby promoting transcriptional activation. Moreover, PAGA and SAGA can also repress gene transcription via the antagonistic effect between PAGA and SAGA. Unlike SAGA, which regulates multiple biological processes, PAGA is specifically involved in plant height and branch growth by regulating the transcription of hormone biosynthesis and response related genes. These results reveal how PAGA and SAGA cooperate to regulate histone acetylation, transcription and development.

We assembled and annotated genome sequences of three kiwifruit species (genus Actinidia) and uncovered recurrent sex chromosome turnovers in multiple lineages. Specifically, we observed structural evolution of the neo-Y chromosomes, which was driven via rapid bursts of transposable element insertions. Surprisingly, sexual dimorphisms were conserved in the different species studied, despite the fact that the partially sex-linked genes differ between them. Using gene editing in kiwifruit, we demonstrated that one of the two Y-chromosome-encoded sex-determining genes, Shy Girl, shows pleiotropic effects that can explain the conserved sexual dimorphisms.

Hybrid necrosis is a post-zygotic isolation mechanism in which cell death develops in the absence of pathogens. It is often due to the incompatibility between proteins from two parents. Here we describe a unique case of hybrid necrosis due to an incompatibility between loci on chromosomes 2 and 7 between two pollinator-isolated Petunia species. Typical immune responses as well as endoplasmic reticulum stress responses are induced in the necrotic line. The locus on chromosome 2 encodes ChiA1, a bifunctional GH18 chitinase/lysozyme. The enzymatic activity of ChiA1 is dispensable for the development of necrosis. We propose that the extremely high expression of ChiA1 involves a positive feedback loop between the loci on chromosomes 2 and 7. ChiA1 is tightly linked to major genes involved in the adaptation to different pollinators, a form of pre-zygotic isolation. This linkage of pre- and post-zygotic barriers strengthens reproductive isolation and probably contributes to rapid diversification and speciation.","2023-03","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:39:42","420-432","","3","9","","Nat.

By improving ribosome footprinting, we reveal that the hem1 mutant increases the translation efficiency of pro-death immune genes. We show that HEM1 contains a plant-specific low-complexity domain (LCD) absent from animal homologues. This LCD endows HEM1 with the capability of phase separation in vitro and in vivo.

Sphagnum (peat moss) species are keystone members of peatland communities where they actively engineer hyperacidic conditions, which improves their competitive advantage and accelerates ecosystem-level carbon sequestration. To dissect the molecular and physiological sources of this unique biology, we generated chromosome-scale genomes of two Sphagnum species: S. divinum and S. angustifolium. Sphagnum genomes show no gene colinearity with any other reference genome to date, demonstrating that Sphagnum represents an unsampled lineage of land plant evolution. The genomes also revealed an average recombination rate an order of magnitude higher than vascular land plants and short putative U/V sex chromosomes. These newly described sex chromosomes interact with autosomal loci that significantly impact growth across diverse pH conditions. This discovery demonstrates that the ability of Sphagnum to sequester carbon in acidic peat bogs is mediated by interactions between sex, autosomes and environment.","2023-02","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:39:42","238-254","","2","9","","Nat.

Although it is known that the floral transition of photoperiod-sensitive plants is tightly controlled by day length, how photoperiod affects their post-flowering development remains to be clearly defined, as do the underlying mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that photoperiod plays a prominent role in seed development. We found that long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) plants produce larger seeds under LD and SD conditions, respectively; however, seed size remains unchanged when CONSTANS (CO), the central regulatory gene of the photoperiodic response pathway, is mutated in Arabidopsis and soybean. We further found that CO directly represses the transcription of AP2 (a known regulatory gene of seed development) under LD conditions in Arabidopsis and SD conditions in soybean, thereby controlling seed size in a photoperiod-dependent manner, and that these effects are exerted through regulation of the proliferation of seed coat epidermal cells. Collectively, our findings reveal that a crucial regulatory cascade involving CO-AP2 modulates photoperiod-mediated seed development in plants and provide new insights into how plants with different photoperiod response types perceive seasonal changes that enable them to optimize their reproductive growth.","2023-02","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:39:42","343-354","","2","9","","Nat.

Present-day and palaeo data define an optimal annual average temperature of 16.9 ± 0.3 °C for olive flowering that has existed at least since the Neolithic period. According to our projections, during the second half of the twenty-first century, temperature increases in Lebanon will have detrimental consequences on olive tree growth and olive oil production, especially in the country’s southern regions, which will become too hot for optimal flowering and fruiting.

By integrating confocal microscopy live-cell imaging and genetics, we have characterized the entire development of the coenocytic endosperm of Arabidopsis thaliana including nuclear divisions, their timing intervals, nuclear movement and cytoskeleton dynamics. Around each nucleus, microtubules organize into aster-shaped structures that drive actin filament (F-actin) organization. Microtubules promote nuclear movement after division, while F-actin restricts it. F-actin is also involved in controlling the size of both the coenocytic endosperm and the mature seed.

Mechanistically, this allele increases proteasome abundance and activity to promote the degradation of reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzymes including peroxidase and catalase upon pathogen infection, leading to elevation of H2O2 accumulation for defence. In contrast, inhibition of proteasome function or overexpression of peroxidase/catalase-encoding genes compromises UMP1R2115-mediated resistance. More importantly, introduction of UMP1R2115 into a disease-susceptible rice variety does not penalize grain yield while promoting disease resistance.

Conducting large-scale genetic screens for paternal plastid transmission, we discovered that mild chilling stress during male gametogenesis leads to increased entry of paternal plastids into sperm cells and strongly increased paternal plastid transmission. We further show that the inheritance of paternal plastid genomes is controlled by the activity of a genome-degrading exonuclease during pollen maturation. Our data reveal that (1) maternal inheritance breaks down under specific environmental conditions, (2) an organelle exclusion mechanism and a genome degradation mechanism act in concert to prevent paternal transmission of plastid genes and (3) plastid inheritance is determined by complex gene–environment interactions.","2023-01","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:39:43","68-80","","1","9","","Nat.

As in plants endocytic and post-Golgi trafficking intersect at the trans-Golgi network, unique mechanisms for sorting cargoes of overlapping vesicular routes are anticipated. The plant AP complexes are part of the sorting machinery, but despite some functional information, their cargoes, accessory proteins and regulation remain largely unknown. Here, by means of various proteomics approaches, we generated the overall interactome of the five AP and the TPLATE complexes in Arabidopsis thaliana. The interactome converged on a number of hub proteins, including the thus far unknown adaptin binding-like protein, designated P34. P34 interacted with the clathrin-associated AP complexes, controlled their stability and, subsequently, influenced clathrin-mediated endocytosis and various post-Golgi trafficking routes. Altogether, the AP interactome network offers substantial resources for further discoveries of unknown endomembrane trafficking regulators in plant cells.","2023-02","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:39:43","355-371","","2","9","","Nat.

WOX4 affects the proliferation of such cells in Populus. Here we show that PtrWOX4a is the most highly expressed stem vascular-cambium-specific (VCS) gene in P. trichocarpa, and its expression is controlled by the product of the second most highly expressed VCS gene, PtrVCS2, encoding a zinc finger protein. PtrVCS2 binds to the PtrWOX4a promoter as part of a PtrWOX13a–PtrVCS2–PtrGCN5-1–PtrADA2b-3 protein tetramer. PtrVCS2 prevented the interaction between PtrGCN5-1 and PtrADA2b-3, resulting in H3K9, H3K14 and H3K27 hypoacetylation at the PtrWOX4a promoter, which led to fewer cambium cell layers. These effects on cambium cell proliferation were consistent across more than 20 sets of transgenic lines overexpressing individual genes, gene-edited mutants and RNA interference lines in P. trichocarpa. We propose that the tetramer–PtrWOX4a system may coordinate genetic and epigenetic regulation to maintain normal vascular cambium development for wood formation.","2023-01","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:39:43","96-111","","1","9","","Nat.

Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of an Arabidopsis ROS1 catalytic fragment in complex with substrate DNA, mismatch DNA and reaction intermediate, respectively. The substrate 5mC is flipped-out from the DNA duplex and subsequently recognized by the ROS1 base-binding pocket through hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions towards the 5-methyl group and Watson–Crick edge respectively, while the different protonation states of the bases determine the substrate preference for 5mC over T:G mismatch. Together with the structure of the reaction intermediate complex, our structural and biochemical studies revealed the molecular basis for substrate specificity, as well as the reaction mechanism underlying 5mC demethylation by the ROS1/DME family of plant-specific DNA demethylases.","2023-02","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:39:43","271-279","","2","9","","Nat.

Nitrogen fixation requires the endosymbionts to differentiate into bacteroids which can be reversible or terminal. The latter is controlled by the plant, it is more beneficial and has evolved in multiple clades of the Leguminosae family. The plant effectors of terminal differentiation in inverted repeat-lacking clade legumes (IRLC) are nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides, which are absent in legumes such as soybean where there is no terminal differentiation of rhizobia. It was assumed that NCRs co-evolved with specific transcription factors, but our work demonstrates that expression of NCR genes does not require NCR-specific transcription factors. Introduction of the Medicago truncatula NCR169 gene under its own promoter into soybean roots resulted in its nodule-specific expression, leading to bacteroid changes associated with terminal differentiation. We identified two AT-Hook Motif Nuclear Localized (AHL) transcription factors from both M. truncatula and soybean nodules that bound to AT-rich sequences in the NCR169 promoter inducing its expression. Whereas mutation of NCR169 arrested bacteroid development at a late stage, the absence of MtAHL1 or MtAHL2 completely blocked bacteroid differentiation indicating that they also regulate other NCR genes required for the development of nitrogen-fixing nodules. Regulation of NCRs by orthologous transcription factors in non-IRLC legumes opens up the possibility of increasing the efficiency of nitrogen fixation in legumes lacking NCRs.","2023-02","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:39:43","280-288","","2","9","","Nat.

Here we report the long-term effects of the stress hormone jasmonic acid (JA) on the defence phenotype, transcriptome and DNA methylome of Arabidopsis. Three weeks after transient JA signalling, 5-week-old plants retained induced resistance (IR) against herbivory but showed increased susceptibility to pathogens. Transcriptome analysis revealed long-term priming and/or upregulation of JA-dependent defence genes but repression of ethylene- and salicylic acid-dependent genes. Long-term JA-IR was associated with shifts in glucosinolate composition and required MYC2/3/4 transcription factors, RNA-directed DNA methylation, the DNA demethylase ROS1 and the small RNA (sRNA)-binding protein AGO1. Although methylome analysis did not reveal consistent changes in DNA methylation near MYC2/3/4-controlled genes, JA-treated plants were specifically enriched with hypomethylated ATREP2 transposable elements (TEs). Epigenomic characterization of mutants and transgenic lines revealed that ATREP2 TEs are regulated by RdDM and ROS1 and produce 21 nt sRNAs that bind to nuclear AGO1. Since ATREP2 TEs are enriched with sequences from IR-related defence genes, our results suggest that AGO1-associated sRNAs from hypomethylated ATREP2 TEs trans-regulate long-lasting memory of JA-dependent immunity.","2023-01","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-06-11 00:44:13","2024-05-27 22:39:43","81-95","","1","9","","Nat.
