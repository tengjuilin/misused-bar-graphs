Strategies to disrupt Treg cell–mediated cancer immunosuppression have been met with limited clinical success, but the underlying mechanisms for treatment failure are poorly understood. By modeling Treg cell–targeted immunotherapy in mice, we find that CD4+ Foxp3− conventional T (Tconv) cells acquire suppressive function upon depletion of Foxp3+ Treg cells, limiting therapeutic efficacy. Foxp3− Tconv cells within tumors adopt a Treg cell–like transcriptional profile upon ablation of Treg cells and acquire the ability to suppress T cell activation and proliferation ex vivo. Suppressive activity is enriched among CD4+ Tconv cells marked by expression of C-C motif receptor 8 (CCR8), which are found in mouse and human tumors. Upon Treg cell depletion, CCR8+ Tconv cells undergo systemic and intratumoral activation and expansion, and mediate IL-10–dependent suppression of antitumor immunity. Consequently, conditional deletion of Il10 within T cells augments antitumor immunity upon Treg cell depletion in mice, and antibody blockade of IL-10 signaling synergizes with Treg cell depletion to overcome treatment resistance. These findings reveal a secondary layer of immunosuppression by Tconv cells released upon therapeutic Treg cell depletion and suggest that broader consideration of suppressive function within the T cell lineage is required for development of effective Treg cell–targeted therapies.","2023-12-15","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:39:56","eabo5558","","90","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/VNH523VH/Whiteside et al. - 2023 - Acquisition of suppressive function by conventiona.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The signals eliciting this noncanonical motility and its relevance for organ surveillance have remained unknown. Using mouse models of viral infections, we report that exocrine gland TRM autonomously generated front-to-back F-actin flow for locomotion, accompanied by high cortical actomyosin contractility, and leading-edge bleb formation. The distinctive mode of exocrine gland TRM locomotion was triggered by sensing physical confinement and was closely correlated with nuclear deformation, which acts as a mechanosensor via an arachidonic acid and Ca2+ signaling pathway. By contrast, naïve CD8+ T cells or TRM surveilling microbe-exposed epithelial barriers did not show mechanosensing capacity. Inhibition of nuclear mechanosensing disrupted exocrine gland TRM scanning and impaired their ability to intercept target cells. These findings indicate that confinement is sufficient to elicit autonomous T cell surveillance in glands with restricted chemokine expression and constitutes a scanning strategy that complements chemosensing-dependent migration.","2023-12-22","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:40:00","eadd5724","","90","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/PBMLSPP4/Ruef et al. - 2023 - Exocrine gland–resident memory CD8+ T cells use me.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How and where adaptive immune responses are induced in ectothermic species in the absence of GCs or analogous SLMs remain poorly understood. Here, we infected a teleost fish (trout) with the parasite Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Ich) and identified the formation of large aggregates of highly proliferating IgM+ B cells and CD4+ T cells, contiguous to splenic melanomacrophage centers (MMCs). Most of these MMC-associated lymphoid aggregates (M-LAs) contained numerous antigen (Ag)–specific B cells. Analysis of the IgM heavy chain CDR3 repertoire of microdissected splenic M-LAs and non–M-LA areas revealed that the most frequent B cell clones induced after Ich infection were highly shared only within the M-LAs of infected animals. These M-LAs represented highly polyclonal SLMs in which Ag-specific B cell clonal expansion occurred. M-LA–associated B cells expressed high levels of activation-induced cytidine deaminase and underwent significant apoptosis, and somatic hypermutation of Igμ genes occurred prevalently in these cells.

Here, we uncover that KCNN4, a calcium-activated potassium channel, links PIEZO-mediated mechanotransduction to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Yoda1, a PIEZO1 agonist, lowered the threshold for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. PIEZO-mediated sensing of stiffness and shear stress increased NLRP3-dependent inflammation. Myeloid-specific deletion of PIEZO1/2 protected mice from gouty arthritis. Mechanistically, activation of PIEZO1 triggers calcium influx, which activates KCNN4 to evoke potassium efflux and promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Activation of PIEZO signaling was sufficient to activate the inflammasome in cells expressing CAPS-causing NLRP3 mutants via KCNN4. Last, pharmacological inhibition of KCNN4 alleviated autoinflammation in cells of patients with CAPS and in mice bearing a CAPS mutation. Thus, PIEZO-dependent mechanical inputs boost inflammation in NLRP3-dependent diseases, including CAPS.","2023-12-22","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:40:03","eadf4699","","90","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/L6EYZK9J/Ran et al. - 2023 - KCNN4 links PIEZO-dependent mechanotransduction to.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, CD8+ T cell priming capacity was enhanced by MAVS ablation in a type I interferon–independent, but IL-12–dependent, manner. Mechanistically, loss of the RIG-I/MAVS cascade activated the noncanonical NF-κB pathway and in turn induced IL-12 production by DCs. MAVS-restrained IL-12 promoted cross-talk between CD8+ T cells and DCs, which was licensed by IFN-γ. Moreover, ablation of host MAVS sensitized tumors to immunotherapy and attenuated radiation resistance, thereby facilitating the maintenance of effector CD8+ T cells. These findings demonstrate that the host MAVS pathway acts as an immune regulator of DC-driven antitumor immunity and support the development of immunotherapies that antagonize MAVS signaling in DCs.","2023-12","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:40:04","eadf4919","","90","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/GFM8ZYBB/Wu et al. - 2023 - Noncanonical MAVS signaling restrains dendritic ce.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we profiled human embryonic and fetal lung immune cells using scRNA-seq, smFISH, and immunohistochemistry. At the embryonic stage, we observed an early wave of innate immune cells, including innate lymphoid cells, natural killer cells, myeloid cells, and lineage progenitors. By the canalicular stage, we detected naive T lymphocytes expressing high levels of cytotoxicity genes and the presence of mature B lymphocytes, including B-1 cells. Our analysis suggests that fetal lungs provide a niche for full B cell maturation. Given the presence and diversity of immune cells during development, we also investigated their possible effect on epithelial maturation. We found that IL-1β drives epithelial progenitor exit from self-renewal and differentiation to basal cells in vitro.

Furthermore, whether Tregs can acquire memory T cell properties and persist for extended periods after their activation in LNs is unclear. Here, we used in situ labeling with a stabilized photoconvertible protein to uncover turnover rates of Tregs in LNs in vivo. We found that, whereas most Tregs in LNs recirculate, 10 to 20% are memory-like resident cells that remain in their respective LNs for weeks to months. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that LN-resident cells are a functionally and ontogenetically heterogeneous population and share the same core residency gene signature with conventional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Resident cells in LNs did not actively proliferate and did not require continuous T cell receptor (TCR) signaling for their residency. However, resident and circulating Tregs had distinct TCR repertoires, and each LN contained exclusive clonal subpopulations of resident Tregs. Our results demonstrate that, similar to conventional T cells, Tregs can form resident memory-like populations in LNs after adaptive immune responses. Specific and local suppression of immune responses by resident Tregs in draining LNs might provide previously unidentified therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of local chronic inflammatory conditions.","2023-10-24","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:40:11","eadj5789","","89","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/TGMPMGHJ/Kaminski et al. - 2023 - Resident regulatory T cells reflect the immune his.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In parallel, a minor population of stem cell–like central memory (TCM) cells forms, which has the capacity to maintain immunity after pathogen clearance. It has remained uncertain whether stem-like TCM cells arise by dedifferentiation from a subset of cytolytic TTE cells or whether priming generates stem-like cells capable of seeding the TCM compartment and, if so, when cytolytic TTE cells branch off. Here, we show that CD8+ T cells with stem-like properties, which are identified by the expression of TCF1 (encoded by Tcf7), are present across the primary response to infection. Priming programs TN cells to undergo multiple cell divisions, over the course of which TCF1 expression is maintained. These TCF1+ cells further expand relatively independently of systemic inflammation, antigen dose, or affinity, and they quantitatively yield TCF1+ TCM cells after pathogen clearance. Inflammatory signals suppress TCF1 expression in early divided TCF1+ cells. TCF1 down-regulation is associated with the irreversible loss of self-renewal capacity and the silencing of stem/memory genes, which precedes the stable acquisition of a TTE state. TCF1 expression restrains cell cycling, explaining in part the limited expansion of TCF1+ relative to TCF1− cells during the primary response. Thus, our data are consistent with terminal differentiation of effector cells being a step-wise process that is initiated by inflammation in primed stem-like cells, which would otherwise become central memory cells by default.","2023-11-17","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:40:12","eadh3113","","89","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/6UKP384R/Silva et al. - 2023 - Emergence and fate of stem cell–like Tcf7+ CD8+ T .pdf","","Log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In mouse models of checkpoint inhibitor–resistant pancreatic cancer, coactivation of Dectin-1, via systemic β-glucan therapy, and CD40, with agonist antibody treatment, eradicated established tumors and induced immunological memory. Antitumor activity was dependent on cDC1s and T cells but did not require classical T cell–mediated cytotoxicity or blockade of checkpoint molecules.

This leads to detrimental effects on their health and quality of life, for which there is no regenerative therapy. Macrophages are the predominant immune cell in the salivary glands and are attractive therapeutic targets due to their unrivaled capacity to drive tissue repair. Yet, the nature and role of macrophages in salivary gland homeostasis and how they may contribute to tissue repair after injury are not well understood. Here, we show that at least two phenotypically and transcriptionally distinct CX3CR1+ macrophage populations are present in the adult salivary gland, which occupy anatomically distinct niches. CD11c+CD206–CD163– macrophages typically associate with gland epithelium, whereas CD11c−CD206+CD163+ macrophages associate with blood vessels and nerves. Using a suite of complementary fate mapping systems, we show that there are highly dynamic changes in the ontogeny and composition of salivary gland macrophages with age. Using an in vivo model of radiation-induced salivary gland injury combined with genetic or antibody-mediated depletion of macrophages, we demonstrate an essential role for macrophages in clearance of cells with DNA damage. Furthermore, we show that epithelial-associated macrophages are indispensable for effective tissue repair and gland function after radiation-induced injury, with their depletion resulting in reduced saliva production. Our data, therefore, provide a strong case for exploring the therapeutic potential of manipulating macrophages to promote tissue repair and thus minimize salivary gland dysfunction after radiotherapy.","2023-11-03","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:40:19","eadd4374","","89","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/Q2EANKN6/McKendrick et al. - 2023 - CSF1R-dependent macrophages in the salivary gland .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we uncover functions for Ikaros in thymic epithelial lineage development in mice and show that Ikzf1 expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is required for both autoimmune regulator–positive (Aire+) mTEC development and tissue-specific antigen (TSA) gene expression. Accordingly, TEC-specific deletion of Ikzf1 in mice results in a profound decrease in Aire+ mTECs, a global loss of TSA gene expression, and the development of autoimmunity. Moreover, Ikaros shapes thymic mimetic cell diversity, and its deletion results in a marked expansion of thymic tuft cells and muscle-like mTECs and a loss of other Aire-dependent mimetic populations. Single-cell analysis reveals that Ikaros modulates core transcriptional programs in TECs that correlate with the observed cellular changes.

However, the molecular mechanisms that trigger neuroinflammation are poorly understood. Viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggers innate immune responses when sensed by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) present in all cell types. Here, we report that human neurons intrinsically carry exceptionally high levels of immunostimulatory dsRNAs and identify long 3′UTRs as giving rise to neuronal dsRNA structures. We found that the neuron-enriched ELAVL family of genes (ELAVL2, ELAVL3, and ELAVL4) can increase (i) 3′UTR length, (ii) dsRNA load, and (iii) activation of dsRNA-sensing PRRs such as MDA5, PKR, and TLR3. In wild-type neurons, neuronal dsRNAs signaled through PRRs to induce tonic production of the antiviral type I interferon. Depleting ELAVL2 in WT neurons led to global shortening of 3′UTR length, reduced immunostimulatory dsRNA levels, and rendered WT neurons susceptible to herpes simplex virus and Zika virus infection. Neurons deficient in ADAR1, a dsRNA-editing enzyme mutated in the neuroinflammatory disorder Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, exhibited intolerably high levels of dsRNA that triggered PRR-mediated toxic inflammation and neuronal death. Depleting ELAVL2 in ADAR1 knockout neurons led to prolonged neuron survival by reducing immunostimulatory dsRNA levels. In summary, neurons are specialized cells where PRRs constantly sense “self” dsRNAs to preemptively induce protective antiviral immunity, but maintaining RNA homeostasis is paramount to prevent pathological neuroinflammation.","2023-10-20","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:41:46","eadg2979","","88","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/YZSK732U/Dorrity et al. - 2023 - Long 3′UTRs predispose neurons to inflammation by .pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, an intratumor stem/progenitor-like CD8+ T cell (Tprog cell) population that mediates the persistence of antitumor responses has been defined, which can further develop into a terminally differentiated CD8+ T cell (Tterm cell) subpopulation with potent cytotoxic functions. Tprog cells are the main responders to immune checkpoint blockade therapies, yet how extrinsic signals via transcription factors control Tprog cell generation and persistence in tumors is unclear. Here, we found that BCL6 inhibits tumor-specific Tterm cell generation from Tprog cell downstream of TCF1. We show that Bcl6 deficiency reduced the persistence of Tprog cells, without affecting their generation, thus abrogating long-term tumor control. High-level BCL6 expression was observed in tumor-specific T cells in draining lymph nodes (LNs) and was associated with T cell exhaustion. This was observed in TOX+TCF1+ Tprog cells in both LNs and tumors. BCL6 expression in CD8+ T cells was up-regulated by TGF-β–SMAD2 signaling but down-regulated by the IL-2–STAT5 pathway. Mechanistically, BCL6 transcriptionally repressed the expression of Tterm cell–associated genes and induced those of Tprog cell–related genes, in a manner antagonistic to BLIMP1. Prdm1 deficiency also promoted the Tprog cell program and greatly improved the efficacy of anti–PD-1 therapy. Thus, we identified the TGF-β–BCL6 and IL-2–BLIMP1 antagonistic pathways in regulation of antitumor CD8+ T cells, which may benefit the development of long-lasting and effective cancer immunotherapy.","2023-10-20","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:41:46","eadh1306","","88","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/VPHYR2JQ/Sun et al. - 2023 - BCL6 promotes a stem-like CD8+ T cell program in c.pdf","","Others","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we examined the consequences of disrupting Il31 and its receptor Il31ra in a mouse model of house dust mite (HDM)–induced allergic dermatitis. Il31-deficient mice displayed a deficit in HDM dermatitis–associated scratching, consistent with its well-established role as a pruritogen. In contrast, Il31 deficiency increased the number and proportion of cutaneous type 2 cytokine–producing CD4+ T cells and serum IgE in response to HDM. Furthermore, Il4ra+ monocytes and macrophages capable of fueling a feedforward type 2 inflammatory loop were selectively enriched in Il31ra-deficient HDM dermatitis skin. Thus, IL-31 is not strictly a proinflammatory cytokine but rather an immunoregulatory factor that limits the magnitude of type 2 inflammatory responses in skin. Our data support a model wherein IL-31 activation of IL31RA+ pruritoceptors triggers release of calcitonin gene-related protein (CGRP), which can mediate neurogenic inflammation, inhibit CD4+ T cell proliferation, and reduce T cell production of the type 2 cytokine IL-13.

Although the structural barrier of CNS border tissues is comparable between neonates and adults, immunofluorescence staining and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses revealed that the neonatal dural immune cells are immature and predominantly composed of CD206hi macrophages, with major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII)hi macrophages being rare. In adults, however, perivenous sinus immune cells were enriched in MHCIIhi macrophages that are specialized for producing antiviral molecules and chemokines compared with CD206hi macrophages and protected the CNS against systemic virus invasion.

Thus, by comparing conventional SPF mice with wildlings, we can uncouple the impact of lifelong microbial exposures from genetic factors on the allergic immune response. We found that wildlings developed larger populations of antigen-experienced T cells than conventional SPF mice, which included interleukin-10–producing CD4 T cells specific for commensal Lactobacilli strains and allergy-promoting T helper 2 (TH2) cells. In models of airway exposure to house dust mite (HDM), recombinant interleukin-33, or Alternaria alternata, wildlings developed strong allergic inflammation, characterized by eosinophil recruitment, goblet cell metaplasia, and antigen-specific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgE responses. Wildlings developed robust de novo TH2 cell responses to incoming allergens, whereas preexisting TH2 cells could also be recruited into the allergic immune response in a cytokine-driven and TCR-independent fashion.

Genetic ablation of Mfn2 in CD8+ T cells dampens mitochondrial metabolism and function and promotes tumor progression. In tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, MFN2 enhances mitochondria–endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contact by interacting with ER-embedded Ca2+-ATPase SERCA2, facilitating the mitochondrial Ca2+ influx required for efficient mitochondrial metabolism. MFN2 stimulates the ER Ca2+ retrieval activity of SERCA2, thereby preventing excessive mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation and apoptosis. Elevating mitochondria-ER contact by increasing MFN2 in CD8+ T cells improves the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.

Identifying pathways that may distinguish tumor-restricted Tregs is important, yet the transcriptional programs that control intratumoral Treg gene expression, and that are distinct from Tregs in healthy tissues, remain largely unknown. We profiled single-cell transcriptomes of CD4+ T cells in tumors and peripheral blood from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and those in nontumor tonsil tissues and peripheral blood from healthy donors. We identified a subpopulation of activated Tregs expressing multiple tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) genes (TNFR+ Tregs) that is highly enriched in the tumor microenvironment (TME) compared with nontumor tissue and the periphery. TNFR+ Tregs are associated with worse prognosis in HNSCC and across multiple solid tumor types. Mechanistically, the transcription factor BATF is a central component of a gene regulatory network that governs key aspects of TNFR+ Tregs. CRISPR-Cas9–mediated BATF knockout in human activated Tregs in conjunction with bulk RNA sequencing, immunophenotyping, and in vitro functional assays corroborated the central role of BATF in limiting excessive activation and promoting the survival of human activated Tregs. Last, we identified a suite of surface molecules reflective of the BATF-driven transcriptional network on intratumoral Tregs in patients with HNSCC.

Single-cell analysis of 17,158 CD8+ T cells from 14 tumor biopsies, including 6 matched pre-post neoadjuvant treatment, revealed that responding tumors had clonally expanded putative tumor-specific exhausted CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) with a tissue-resident memory program, characterized by high cytotoxic potential (CTX+) and ZNF683 expression, within the baseline TME. Pathologic responses after 5 weeks of PD-1 blockade were consistent with activation of preexisting CTX+ZNF683+CD8+ TILs, paralleling loss of viable tumor and associated tumor antigens. Response was associated with high numbers of CD103+PD-1+CD8+ T cells infiltrating pretreatment lesions, whereas revival of nonexhausted persisting clones and clonal replacement were modest. By contrast, nonresponder baseline TME exhibited a relative absence of ZNF683+CTX+ TILs and subsequent accumulation of highly exhausted clones.

Whereas it is well established that single-cell migration is often guided by gradients of chemokines and other chemoattractants, it remains poorly understood how these gradients are generated, maintained, and modulated. By combining experimental data with theory on leukocyte chemotaxis guided by the G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) CCR7, we demonstrate that in addition to its role as the sensory receptor that steers migration, CCR7 also acts as a generator and a modulator of chemotactic gradients. Upon exposure to the CCR7 ligand CCL19, dendritic cells (DCs) effectively internalize the receptor and ligand as part of the canonical GPCR desensitization response. We show that CCR7 internalization also acts as an effective sink for the chemoattractant, dynamically shaping the spatiotemporal distribution of the chemokine. This mechanism drives complex collective migration patterns, enabling DCs to create or sharpen chemotactic gradients. We further show that these self-generated gradients can sustain the long-range guidance of DCs, adapt collective migration patterns to the size and geometry of the environment, and provide a guidance cue for other comigrating cells. Such a dual role of CCR7 as a GPCR that both senses and consumes its ligand can thus provide a novel mode of cellular self-organization.","2023-09","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:42:00","eadc9584","","87","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/TYTTKTH6/Alanko et al. - 2023 - CCR7 acts as both a sensor and a sink for CCL19 to.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To characterize their source, we generated a knock-in reporter mouse in which endogenous Cyp11b1, the final enzyme in de novo production of active glucocorticoids, was fluorescently tagged with mScarlet. Here, we find that Cyp11b1 is expressed in medullary TECs (mTECs) but not cortical TECs or other cells in the thymus. A distinct characteristic of mTECs is the presence of Aire, a transcription factor that drives expression of tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs) important for establishing immune tolerance. Cyp11b1 expression was highest in Aire+ mTECs, lower in post-Aire mTECs, and absent in mTECs of Aire-deficient mice. Transcriptomic analyses found that multiple enzymatic biosynthetic pathways are expressed specifically in mTECs and are also Aire dependent. In particular, we found that the thymus expresses messenger RNA for enzymes that catalyze production of many bioactive steroids and that glucocorticoids and sex steroids were secreted by cultured thymi. Expression of the transcripts for these genes and production of their final steroid products were markedly reduced in the absence of Aire. Thus, in addition to its well-established role in inducing TRAs that promote negative selection, Aire has an additional and contrary function of inducing glucocorticoids that antagonize negative selection, which together may expand and enhance the TCR repertoire. Furthermore, because Aire drives expression of multiple enzymes responsible for production of other non–gene-encoded bioactive molecules, it might have yet other roles in thymus development and function.","2023-08-18","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:42:01","eabo7975","","86","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/HKBENRH3/Taves et al. - 2023 - Aire drives steroid hormone biosynthesis by medull.pdf","","Log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pulmonary macrophages with a type 2 transcriptional and epigenetic signature persist in the lungs of N. brasiliensis–exposed mice after clearance of the parasite and establish a primed environment for increased CD8+ T cell recruitment and activation. Accordingly, depletion of macrophages ablated the augmented viral clearance and accumulation of CD8+ T cells driven by prior N. brasiliensis infection.

To investigate this, we used the mouse model of chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. Treatment of chronically infected mice with either αPD-1 or αPD-L1 antibody not only increased effector cell differentiation from the virus-specific stem-like CD8 T cells but also increased their proliferation so their numbers were maintained. The increased self-renewal of LCMV-specific stem-like CD8 T cells was mTOR dependent. We used microscopy to understand the division of these progenitor cells and found that after PD-1 blockade, an individual dividing cell could give rise to a differentiated TCF-1− daughter cell alongside a self-renewing TCF-1+ sister cell. This asymmetric division helped to preserve the number of stem-like cells. Moreover, we found that the PD-1+TCF-1+ stem-like CD8 T cells retained their transcriptional program and their in vivo functionality in terms of responding to viral infection and to repeat PD-1 blockade.

Here, IFN-I signaling was modulated in rhesus macaques (RMs) before and during acute SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection using a mutated IFN-α2 (IFN-modulator; IFNmod), which has previously been shown to reduce the binding and signaling of endogenous IFN-I. IFNmod treatment in uninfected RMs was observed to induce a modest up-regulation of only antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs); however, in SARS-CoV-2–infected RMs, IFNmod reduced both antiviral and inflammatory ISGs. IFNmod treatment resulted in a potent reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral loads both in vitro in Calu-3 cells and in vivo in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), upper airways, lung, and hilar lymph nodes of RMs. Furthermore, in SARS-CoV-2–infected RMs, IFNmod treatment potently reduced inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and CD163+ MRC1− inflammatory macrophages in BAL and expression of Siglec-1 on circulating monocytes. In the lung, IFNmod also reduced pathogenesis and attenuated pathways of inflammasome activation and stress response during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using an intervention targeting both IFN-α and IFN-β pathways, this study shows that, whereas early IFN-I restrains SARS-CoV-2 replication, uncontrolled IFN-I signaling critically contributes to SARS-CoV-2 inflammation and pathogenesis in the moderate disease model of RMs.","2023-07-28","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:42:53","eadg0033","","85","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/8ZQM229C/Viox et al. - 2023 - Modulation of type I interferon responses potently.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas activation of all other inflammasomes is triggered by sensing of pathogen products by a specific host cytosolic pattern recognition receptor protein, whether pattern recognition receptors for cLPS exist has remained unclear, because caspase-4, caspase-5, and caspase-11 bind and activate LPS directly in vitro. Here, we show that the primate-specific protein NLRP11 is a pattern recognition receptor for cLPS that is required for efficient activation of the caspase-4 inflammasome in human macrophages. In human macrophages, NLRP11 is required for efficient activation of caspase-4 during infection with intracellular Gram-negative bacteria or upon electroporation of LPS. NLRP11 could bind LPS and separately caspase-4, forming a high–molecular weight complex with caspase-4 in HEK293T cells. NLRP11 is present in humans and other primates but absent in mice, likely explaining why it has been overlooked in screens looking for innate immune signaling molecules, most of which have been carried out in mice.

These resident cells have essential roles defining the character of the resulting T cell response; however, it is unknown how they can appropriately process and present antigens to suitably direct responses given their spatial separation. Here, using a novel strain of influenza A and a modified melanoma model, we show that tissue and lymph node cDC activation is harmonized and that this is driven by cotransfer of contextual cues. In the tumor, incomplete cDC activation in the tumor microenvironment is mirrored by lymph node–resident cDCs, whereas during influenza infection, pathogen-associated molecular patterns cotransferred with antigen drive TLR signaling in resident cDCs and their subsequent robust activation. This cotransfer mechanism explains how individual antigens can be handled distinctly by resident cDCs and how signals driving poor tumoral cDC activation further impact the lymph node.

More recent evidence suggested that these cells may also develop postnatally in the thymus. Here, we used high-dimensional flow cytometry, transcriptomic analysis, functional assays, and precursor-product experiments to define the development pathway of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in the postnatal thymus. We identify three distinct stages of development for Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in the postnatal thymus that are defined by the progressive acquisition of functional potential and major changes in the expression of transcription factors, chemokines, and other surface markers. Furthermore, our analysis of donor-matched thymus and blood revealed that the molecular requirements for the development of functional Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are delivered predominantly by the postnatal thymus and not in the periphery. Tbet and Eomes, which are required for IFN-γ and TNFα expression, are up-regulated as Vγ9Vδ2 T cells mature in the thymus, and mature thymic Vγ9Vδ2 T cells rapidly express high levels of these cytokines after stimulation. Similarly, the postnatal thymus programs Vγ9Vδ2 T cells to express the cytolytic molecules, perforin, granzyme A, and granzyme K. This study provides a greater understanding of how Vγ9Vδ2 T cells develop in humans and may lead to opportunities to manipulate these cells to treat human diseases.","2023-07-14","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:42:57","eabo4365","","85","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/5HZ9B3ZY/Perriman et al. - 2023 - A three-stage developmental pathway for human Vγ9V.pdf","","Log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Natural CD8+ αβ and γδ T-IELs expressing activating natural killer cell receptors (NKRs) exhibited a distinct TCR repertoire in CD and persisted in patients on a gluten-free diet without intestinal inflammation. Our data further show that NKR-expressing cytotoxic cells, which appear to mediate intestinal damage in CD, arise from a distinct NKR-expressing memory population of T-IELs. After gluten ingestion, both αβ and γδ T cell clones from this memory population of T-IELs circulated systemically along with gluten-specific CD4+ T cells and assumed a cytotoxic and activating NKR-expressing phenotype.

Within 9 days of reprogramming, tumor-APCs acquired transcriptional and epigenetic programs associated with cDC1 cells. Reprogramming restored the expression of antigen presentation complexes and costimulatory molecules on the surfaces of tumor cells, allowing the presentation of endogenous tumor antigens on MHC-I and facilitating targeted killing by CD8+ T cells. Functionally, tumor-APCs engulfed and processed proteins and dead cells, secreted inflammatory cytokines, and cross-presented antigens to naïve CD8+ T cells. Human primary tumor cells could also be reprogrammed to increase their capability to present antigen and to activate patient-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. In addition to acquiring improved antigen presentation, tumor-APCs had impaired tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Injection of in vitro generated melanoma-derived tumor-APCs into subcutaneous melanoma tumors delayed tumor growth and increased survival in mice.

In memory TH2 cells, recall genes were epigenetically primed through the maintenance of transcription-permissive chromatin at distal (super)enhancers organized in long-range 3D chromatin hubs. Precise transcriptional control of key recall genes occurred inside dedicated topologically associating domains (“memory TADs”), in which activation-associated promoter-enhancer interactions were preformed and exploited by AP-1 transcription factors to promote rapid transcriptional induction. Resting memory TH2 cells from patients with asthma showed premature activation of primed recall circuits, linking aberrant transcriptional control of recall responses to chronic inflammation.

Here, we identify a population of pulmonary dendritic cells (DCs) that express intermediate levels of CD103 (CD103int) and appear in the lungs and lung-draining lymph nodes of mice between birth and 2 weeks of age. CD103int DCs express XCR1 and CD205 and require expression of the transcription factor BATF3 for development, suggesting that they belong to the cDC1 lineage. In addition, CD103int DCs express CCR7 constitutively and spontaneously migrate to the lung-draining lymph node, where they promote stromal cell maturation and lymph node expansion. CD103int DCs mature independently of microbial exposure and TRIF- or MyD88-dependent signaling and are transcriptionally related to efferocytic and tolerogenic DCs as well as mature, regulatory DCs. Correlating with this, CD103int DCs show limited ability to stimulate proliferation and IFN-γ production by CD8+ T cells. Moreover, CD103int DCs acquire apoptotic cells efficiently, in a process that is dependent on the expression of the TAM receptor, Mertk, which drives their homeostatic maturation. The appearance of CD103int DCs coincides with a temporal wave of apoptosis in developing lungs and explains, in part, dampened pulmonary immunity in neonatal mice. Together, these data suggest a mechanism by which DCs sense apoptotic cells at sites of noninflammatory tissue remodeling, such as tumors or the developing lungs, and limit local T cell responses.","2023-06-16","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:43:49","eadc9081","","84","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/CXDFPE8H/Silva-Sanchez et al. - 2023 - Activation of regulatory dendritic cells by Mertk .pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diverse stimuli activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, and unifying upstream signals has been challenging to identify. Here, we report that a common upstream step in NLRP3 inflammasome activation is the dissociation of the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase 2 from the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in the outer membrane of mitochondria. Hexokinase 2 dissociation from VDAC triggers activation of inositol triphosphate receptors, leading to release of calcium from the ER, which is taken up by mitochondria. This influx of calcium into mitochondria leads to oligomerization of VDAC, which is known to form a macromolecule-sized pore in the outer membranes of mitochondria that allows proteins and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), often associated with apoptosis and inflammation, respectively, to exit the mitochondria. We observe that VDAC oligomers aggregate with NLRP3 during initial assembly of the multiprotein oligomeric NLRP3 inflammasome complex. We also find that mtDNA is necessary for NLRP3 association with VDAC oligomers. These data, together with other recent work, help to paint a more complete picture of the pathway leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation.","2023-06-16","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:43:50","eade7652","","84","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/NATKKDEK/Baik et al. - 2023 - Hexokinase dissociation from mitochondria promotes.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we investigated the acute immune response induced by after CRT. Contrary to non-CRT approaches, we found that CRT induces a rapid and robust recruitment of monocytes to the tumor that minimally differentiate into tumor-associated macrophages or dendritic cells but instead up-regulate major histocompatibility complex II and costimulatory molecules. We found that these large numbers of infiltrating monocytes are responsible for activating effector polyfunctional CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that reduce tumor burden. Mechanistically, we show that monocyte-derived type I interferon is pivotal in promoting monocyte accumulation and immunostimulatory function in a positive feedback loop. We also demonstrate that monocyte accumulation in the tumor microenvironment is hindered when RT inadvertently affects healthy tissues, as occurs in non-CRT.

CD1a is expressed at constitutively high levels by Langerhans cells and presents lipid antigens to T cells, but the potential relevance to GAS infection has not been studied. Here, we investigated whether GAS-responsive CD1a-restricted T cells contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Healthy individuals had high frequencies of circulating and cutaneous GAS-responsive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with rapid effector functions, including the production of interleukin-22 (IL-22). Human skin and blood single-cell CITE-seq analyses of IL-22–producing T cells showed a type 17 signature with proliferative potential, whereas IFN-γ–producing T cells displayed cytotoxic T lymphocyte characteristics. Furthermore, individuals with psoriasis had significantly higher frequencies of circulating GAS-reactive T cells, enriched for markers of activation, cytolytic potential, and tissue association. In addition to responding to GAS, subsets of expanded GAS-reactive T cell clones/lines were found to be autoreactive, which included the recognition of the self-lipid antigen lysophosphatidylcholine.

Furthermore, we established cutaneous models of GAS infection in a humanized CD1a transgenic mouse model and identified enhanced and prolonged local and systemic inflammation, with resolution through a psoriasis-like phenotype.

New therapeutic approaches, including vaccination and immunotherapy, are urgently needed to combat the rapid global dissemination of multidrug-resistant uropathogens. Development of therapies is impeded by an incomplete understanding of memory development during UTI. Here, we found that reducing bacterial load early in infection, by reducing the inoculum or with antibiotics after infection, completely abrogated the protective memory response. We observed a mixed T helper (TH) cell polarization, composed of TH1, TH2, and TH17 T cells, among T cells infiltrating the bladder during primary infection. Thus, we hypothesized that reducing antigen load altered TH cell polarization, leading to poor memory. Unexpectedly, however, TH cell polarization was unchanged in these scenarios. Instead, we uncovered a population of tissue-resident memory (TRM) T cells that was significantly reduced in the absence of sufficient antigen. Demonstrating that TRM cells are necessary for immune memory, transfer of lymph node– or spleen-derived infection-experienced T cells to naïve animals did not confer protection against infection. Supporting that TRM cells are sufficient to protect against recurrent UTI, animals depleted of systemic T cells, or treated with FTY720 to block memory lymphocyte migration from lymph nodes to infected tissue, were equally protected compared with unmanipulated mice against a second UTI. Thus, we uncovered an unappreciated key role for TRM cells in the memory response to bacterial infection in the bladder mucosa, providing a target for non–antibiotic-based immunotherapy and/or new vaccine strategies to prevent recurrent UTI.","2023-05-26","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:44:07","eabn4332","","83","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/NKMWI2MS/Rousseau et al. - 2023 - Tissue-resident memory T cells mediate mucosal imm.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compensatory mechanisms, including IgM, have been proposed, yet it remains unclear how secretory IgA and IgM work together in the mucosal system and, on a larger scale, whether the systemic and mucosal anti-commensal responses are redundant or have unique features. To address this gap in knowledge, we developed an integrated host-commensal approach combining microbial flow cytometry and metagenomic sequencing (mFLOW-Seq) to comprehensively define which microbes induce mucosal and systemic antibodies. We coupled this approach with high-dimensional immune profiling to study a cohort of pediatric patients with SIgAD and household control siblings. We found that mucosal and systemic antibody networks cooperate to maintain homeostasis by targeting a common subset of commensal microbes. In IgA-deficiency, we find increased translocation of specific bacterial taxa associated with elevated levels of systemic IgG targeting fecal microbiota. Associated features of immune system dysregulation in IgA-deficient mice and humans included elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, enhanced follicular CD4 T helper cell frequency and activation, and an altered CD8 T cell activation state. Although SIgAD is clinically defined by the absence of serum IgA, the symptomatology and immune dysregulation were concentrated in the SIgAD participants who were also fecal IgA deficient. These findings reveal that mucosal IgA deficiency leads to aberrant systemic exposures and immune responses to commensal microbes, which increase the likelihood of humoral and cellular immune dysregulation and symptomatic disease in patients with IgA deficiency.","2023-05-26","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:44:09","eade2335","","83","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/B9VTY83G/Conrey et al. - 2023 - IgA deficiency destabilizes homeostasis toward int.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found that the engulfment of apoptotic cells triggered homeostatic maturation of type 1 conventional DCs (cDC1s) within the spleen. This maturation process could be mimicked by engulfment of empty, nonadjuvanted lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), was marked by intracellular accumulation of cholesterol, and was highly specific to cDC1s. Engulfment of either apoptotic cells or cholesterol-rich LNPs led to the activation of the liver X receptor (LXR) pathway, which promotes the efflux of cellular cholesterol, and repressed genes associated with immunogenic maturation. In contrast, simultaneous engagement of TLR3 to mimic viral infection via administration of poly(I:C)-adjuvanted LNPs repressed the LXR pathway, thus delaying cellular cholesterol efflux and inducing genes that promote T cell–mediated immunity.

Here, we exploited differences between inbred mouse strains to identify an epithelium-intrinsic mechanism that regulates tuft cell differentiation and tunes innate type 2 immunity in the small intestine. Balb/cJ (Balb) mice had fewer intestinal tuft cells than C57BL/6J (B6) mice and failed to respond to the tuft cell ligand succinate. Most of this differential succinate response was determined by the 50- to 67-Mb interval of chromosome 9 (Chr9), such that congenic Balb mice carrying the B6 Chr9 interval had elevated baseline numbers of tuft cells and responded to succinate. The Chr9 locus includes Pou2af2, which encodes the protein OCA-T1, a transcriptional cofactor essential for tuft cell development. Epithelial crypts expressed a previously unannotated short isoform of Pou2af2 predicted to use a distinct transcriptional start site and encode a nonfunctional protein. Low tuft cell numbers and the resulting lack of succinate response in Balb mice were explained by a preferential expression of the short isoform and could be rescued by expression of full-length Pou2af2. Physiologically, Pou2af2 isoform usage tuned innate type 2 immunity in the small intestine. Balb mice maintained responsiveness to helminth pathogens while ignoring commensal Tritrichomonas protists and reducing norovirus burdens.","2023-05-12","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:44:16","eade5019","","83","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/HXYEPLYR/Nadjsombati et al. - 2023 - Genetic mapping reveals Pou2af2OCA-T1–dependent t.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a human model of allergen-induced asthma exacerbation, we compared the lower airway mucosa in allergic asthmatics and allergic non-asthmatic controls using single-cell RNA sequencing. In response to allergen, the asthmatic airway epithelium was highly dynamic and up-regulated genes involved in matrix degradation, mucus metaplasia, and glycolysis while failing to induce injury-repair and antioxidant pathways observed in controls. IL9-expressing pathogenic TH2 cells were specific to asthmatic airways and were only observed after allergen challenge. Additionally, conventional type 2 dendritic cells (DC2 that express CD1C) and CCR2-expressing monocyte-derived cells (MCs) were uniquely enriched in asthmatics after allergen, with up-regulation of genes that sustain type 2 inflammation and promote pathologic airway remodeling. In contrast, allergic controls were enriched for macrophage-like MCs that up-regulated tissue repair programs after allergen challenge, suggesting that these populations may protect against asthmatic airway remodeling. Cellular interaction analyses revealed a TH2–mononuclear phagocyte–basal cell interactome unique to asthmatics. These pathogenic cellular circuits were characterized by type 2 programming of immune and structural cells and additional pathways that may sustain and amplify type 2 signals, including TNF family signaling, altered cellular metabolism, failure to engage antioxidant responses, and loss of growth factor signaling. Our findings therefore suggest that pathogenic effector circuits and the absence of proresolution programs drive structural airway disease in response to type 2 inflammation.","2023-05-05","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:44:18","eabq6352","","83","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/SMCGYCPF/Alladina et al. - 2023 - A human model of asthma exacerbation reveals trans.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we investigated a cohort of patients who developed myocarditis and/or pericarditis with elevated troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide, and C-reactive protein levels as well as cardiac imaging abnormalities shortly after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Contrary to early hypotheses, patients did not demonstrate features of hypersensitivity myocarditis, nor did they have exaggerated SARS-CoV-2–specific or neutralizing antibody responses consistent with a hyperimmune humoral mechanism. We additionally found no evidence of cardiac-targeted autoantibodies. Instead, unbiased systematic immune serum profiling revealed elevations in circulating interleukins (IL-1β, IL-1RA, and IL-15), chemokines (CCL4, CXCL1, and CXCL10), and matrix metalloproteases (MMP1, MMP8, MMP9, and TIMP1). Subsequent deep immune profiling using single-cell RNA and repertoire sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells during acute disease revealed expansion of activated CXCR3+ cytotoxic T cells and NK cells, both phenotypically resembling cytokine-driven killer cells. In addition, patients displayed signatures of inflammatory and profibrotic CCR2+ CD163+ monocytes, coupled with elevated serum-soluble CD163, that may be linked to the late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac MRI, which can persist for months after vaccination. Together, our results demonstrate up-regulation in inflammatory cytokines and corresponding lymphocytes with tissue-damaging capabilities, suggesting a cytokine-dependent pathology, which may further be accompanied by myeloid cell–associated cardiac fibrosis.

In this work, we investigated the role of the TF Bcl11b in TRM cells during infection with Listeria monocytogenes using mice with post-activation, conditional deletion of Bcl11b in CD8+ T cells. Conditional deletion of Bcl11b resulted in increased numbers of intestinal TRM cells and their precursors as well as decreased splenic effector and circulating memory cells and precursors. Loss of circulating memory cells was in part due to increased intestinal homing of Bcl11b−/− circulating precursors, with no major alterations in their programs. Bcl11b−/− TRM cells had altered transcriptional programs, with diminished expression of multipotent/multifunctional (MP/MF) program genes, including Tcf7, and up-regulation of the effector program genes, including Prdm1. Bcl11b also limits the expression of Ahr, another TF with a role in intestinal CD8+ TRM cell differentiation. Deregulation of TRM programs translated into a poor recall response despite TRM cell accumulation in the intestine. Reduced expression of MP/MF program genes in Bcl11b−/− TRM cells was linked to decreased chromatin accessibility and a reduction in activating histone marks at these loci. In contrast, the effector program genes displayed increased activating epigenetic status.

The vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C)/VEGF receptor 3 (VEGFR3) signaling pathway is essential for the development and maintenance of dural LVs. However, its significance in mediating dural lymphatic function in CNS autoimmunity is unclear. We show that inhibition of the VEGF-C/VEGFR3 signaling pathway using a monoclonal VEGFR3-blocking antibody, a soluble VEGF-C/D trap, or deletion of the Vegfr3 gene in adult lymphatic endothelium causes notable regression and functional impairment of dural LVs but has no effect on the development of CNS autoimmunity in mice. During autoimmune neuroinflammation, the dura mater was only minimally affected, and neuroinflammation-induced helper T (TH) cell recruitment, activation, and polarization were significantly less pronounced in the dura mater than in the CNS. In support of this notion, during autoimmune neuroinflammation, blood vascular endothelial cells in the cranial and spinal dura expressed lower levels of cell adhesion molecules and chemokines, and antigen-presenting cells (i.e., macrophages and dendritic cells) had lower expression of chemokines, MHC class II–associated molecules, and costimulatory molecules than their counterparts in the brain and spinal cord, respectively.

We investigated factors that underlie TRM maintenance in a kidney transplantation model in which TRM cells drive rejection. In contrast to acute infection, we found that TRM cells declined markedly in the absence of cognate antigen, antigen presentation, or antigen sensing by the T cells. Depletion of graft-infiltrating dendritic cells or interruption of antigen presentation after TRM cells were established was sufficient to disrupt TRM maintenance and reduce allograft pathology. Likewise, removal of IL-15 transpresentation or of the IL-15 receptor on T cells during TRM maintenance led to a decline in TRM cells, and IL-15 receptor blockade prevented chronic rejection. Therefore, antigen and IL-15 presented by dendritic cells play nonredundant key roles in CD8 TRM cell maintenance in settings of antigen persistence and inflammation.

Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) is a ubiquitous cytoplasmic kinase regulating cell death outcomes, including apoptosis and necroptosis.

The patient’s fibroblasts displayed no detectable RIPK3 expression. After TNFR1 or TLR3 stimulation, the patient’s cells did not undergo apoptosis or necroptosis. After HSV-1 infection, the cells supported excessive viral growth despite normal induction of antiviral IFN-β and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs).

MPC inhibition using a second-generation insulin sensitizer, MSDC-0602K (MSDC), dampened pulmonary inflammation and promoted lung recovery while concurrently reducing blood glucose levels and hyperlipidemia after viral pneumonia in obese mice. Mechanistically, MPC inhibition enhanced mitochondrial fitness and destabilized hypoxia-inducible factor–1α, leading to dampened virus-induced inflammatory responses in both murine and human lung macrophages. We further showed that MSDC enhanced responses to nirmatrelvir (the antiviral component of Paxlovid) to provide high levels of protection against severe host disease development after SARS-CoV-2 infection and suppressed cellular inflammation in human COVID-19 lung autopsies, demonstrating its translational potential for treating severe COVID-19.

However, GSDMB has a controversial role in pyroptosis and has been linked to both anti- and protumor functions. Here, we found that GSDMB splicing variants are functionally distinct. Cleaved N-terminal (NT) fragments of GSDMB isoforms 3 and 4 caused pyroptosis, but isoforms 1, 2, and 5 did not. The nonfunctional isoforms have a deleted or modified exon 6 and therefore lack a stable belt motif. The belt likely contributes to the insertion of oligomeric GSDMB-NTs into the membrane. Consistently, noncytotoxic GSDMB-NTs blocked pyroptosis caused by cytotoxic GSDMB-NTs in a dominant-negative manner. Upon natural killer (NK) cell attack, GSDMB3-expressing cells died by pyroptosis, whereas GSDMB4-expressing cells died by mixed pyroptosis and apoptosis, and GSDMB1/2-expressing cells died only by apoptosis. GSDMB4 partially resisted NK cell-triggered cleavage, suggesting that only GSDMB3 is fully functional. GSDMB1-3 were the most abundant isoforms in the tested tumor cell lines and were similarly induced by interferon-γ and the chemotherapy drug methotrexate. Expression of cytotoxic GSDMB3/4 isoforms, but not GSDMB1/2 isoforms that are frequently up-regulated in tumors, was associated with better outcomes in bladder and cervical cancers, suggesting that GSDMB3/4-mediated pyroptosis was protective in those tumors. Our study indicates that tumors may block and evade killer cell-triggered pyroptosis by generating noncytotoxic GSDMB isoforms. Therefore, therapeutics that favor the production of cytotoxic GSDMB isoforms by alternative splicing may improve antitumor immunity.","2023-04-28","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:45:16","eadg3196","","82","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/QQ977E54/Kong et al. - 2023 - Alternative splicing of GSDMB modulates killer lym.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Upon loading onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, they can trigger recognition by T cells. Accurate neoantigen identification is thus critical for both designing cancer vaccines and predicting response to immunotherapies. Neoantigen identification and prioritization relies on correctly predicting whether the presenting peptide sequence can successfully induce an immune response. Because most somatic mutations are single-nucleotide variants, changes between wild-type and mutated peptides are typically subtle and require cautious interpretation. A potentially underappreciated variable in neoantigen prediction pipelines is the mutation position within the peptide relative to its anchor positions for the patient’s specific MHC molecules. Whereas a subset of peptide positions are presented to the T cell receptor for recognition, others are responsible for anchoring to the MHC, making these positional considerations critical for predicting T cell responses. We computationally predicted anchor positions for different peptide lengths for 328 common HLA alleles and identified unique anchoring patterns among them. Analysis of 923 tumor samples shows that 6 to 38% of neoantigen candidates are potentially misclassified and can be rescued using allele-specific knowledge of anchor positions.

Here, we used human liver and lung single-cell RNA sequencing datasets to identify a subset of CD9+TREM2+ macrophages that express SPP1, GPNMB, FABP5, and CD63. In both human and murine hepatic and pulmonary fibrosis, these macrophages were enriched at the outside edges of scarring and adjacent to activated mesenchymal cells. Neutrophils expressing MMP9, which participates in the activation of TGF-β1, and the type 3 cytokines GM-CSF and IL-17A coclustered with these macrophages. In vitro, GM-CSF, IL-17A, and TGF-β1 drive the differentiation of human monocytes into macrophages expressing scar-associated markers. Such differentiated cells could degrade collagen IV but not collagen I and promote TGF-β1–induced collagen I deposition by activated mesenchymal cells. In murine models blocking GM-CSF, IL-17A or TGF-β1 reduced scar-associated macrophage expansion and hepatic or pulmonary fibrosis.

Here, we analyze peripheral blood γδ T cells from a South African adolescent cohort and show that a unique CD8+ γδ T cell subset with features of “memory inflation” expands in chronic Mtb infection. These cells are hyporesponsive to T cell receptor (TCR)–mediated signaling but, like NK cells, can mount robust CD16-mediated cytotoxic responses.

Because of challenges in detecting indels, the mechanism that generates indels during immunoglobulin diversification processes remains poorly understood. We carried out ultra-deep profiling of indels and systematically dissected the underlying mechanisms using passenger-immunoglobulin mouse models. We found that activation-induced cytidine deaminase–dependent ±1–base pair (bp) indels are the most prevalent indel events, biasing deleterious outcomes, whereas longer in-frame indels, especially insertions that can extend the CDR3 length, are rare outcomes. The ±1-bp indels are channeled by base excision repair, but longer indels require additional DNA-processing factors. Ectopic expression of a DNA exonuclease or perturbation of the balance of DNA polymerases can increase the frequency of longer indels, thus paving the way for models that can generate antibodies with long CDR3. Our study reveals the mechanisms that generate beneficial and deleterious indels during the process of antibody somatic hypermutation and has implications in understanding the detrimental genomic alterations in various conditions, including tumorigenesis.","2023-03-24","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:45:24","eade1167","","81","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/VVNCVVFM/Hao et al. - 2023 - DNA repair mechanisms that promote insertion-delet.pdf","","No problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although this interaction occurs in a B:T synapse–dependent manner, how CD4 T cells transcriptionally regulate B:T synapse formation remains largely unknown. Here, we report that Mef2d, an isoform of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (Mef2) transcription factor family, is a critical regulator of this process. In CD4 T cells, Mef2d negatively regulates expression of Sh2d1a, which encodes SLAM-associated protein (SAP), a critical regulator of B:T synapses. We found that Mef2d regulates Sh2d1a expression via DNA binding–dependent transcriptional repression, inhibiting SAP-dependent B:T synapse formation and preventing antigen-specific CD4 T cells from differentiating into GC-TFH cells. Mef2d also impeded IL-21 production by CD4 T cells, an important B cell help signaling molecule, via direct repression of the Il21 gene. In contrast, CD4 T cell–specific disruption of Mef2d led to a substantial increase in GC-TFH differentiation in response to protein immunization, concurrent with enhanced SAP expression. MEF2D mRNA expression inversely correlates with human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient autoimmune parameters, including circulating TFH–like cell frequencies, autoantibodies, and SLEDAI scores.

Transplanted HSPCs underwent rapid and measurable changes during the first 30 days after transplantation, characterized by a strong proliferative response on the first day. Transcriptomic analysis of HSPCs enabled us to observe that immunoregulatory neutrophil progenitors expressing high levels of the S100A gene family were enriched in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor–mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. Transplant recipients who developed acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) infused fewer S100Ahigh immunoregulatory neutrophil progenitors, immunophenotyped as Lin-CD34+CD66b+CD177+, than those who did not develop aGVHD.

Anaphylaxis is triggered when blood-borne allergens activate IgE-bound perivascular mast cells (MCs) throughout the body, causing an extensive systemic release of MC mediators. Through precipitating vasodilatation and vascular leakage, these mediators are believed to trigger a sharp drop in blood pressure in humans and in core body temperature in animals. We report that the IgE/MC-mediated drop in body temperature in mice associated with anaphylaxis also requires the body’s thermoregulatory neural circuit. This circuit is activated when granule-borne chymase from MCs is deposited on proximal TRPV1+ sensory neurons and stimulates them via protease-activated receptor-1. This triggers the activation of the body’s thermoregulatory neural network, which rapidly attenuates brown adipose tissue thermogenesis to cause hypothermia. Mice deficient in either chymase or TRPV1 exhibited limited IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, and, in wild-type mice, anaphylaxis could be recapitulated simply by systemically activating TRPV1+ sensory neurons. Thus, in addition to their well-known effects on the vasculature, MC products, especially chymase, promote IgE-mediated anaphylaxis by activating the thermoregulatory neural circuit.","2023-03-17","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-27 23:45:28","eadc9417","","81","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/6KQZ8NHZ/Bao et al. - 2023 - A mast cell–thermoregulatory neuron circuit axis r.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, using transgenic mouse models of metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma, we found that Pygo2 deletion decelerated tumor progression, diminished metastases, and extended survival.

Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Pygo2 enhanced the antitumor efficacy of immunotherapies using immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), adoptive cell transfer, or agents inhibiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells.

It is unknown whether variation in the ability of the IgG1 Fc region to engage FcγRs renders mAbs with superior therapeutic activity. In this study, we used humanized FcγR mice to study the contribution of FcγR signaling to the antitumor activity of human anti–PD-L1 mAbs and to identify an optimal human IgG scaffold for PD-L1 mAbs. We observed similar antitumor efficacy and comparable tumor immune responses in mice treated with anti–PD-L1 mAbs with wild-type and Fc-mutated IgG scaffolds. However, in vivo antitumor activity of the wild-type anti–PD-L1 mAb avelumab was enhanced by combination treatment with an FcγRIIB-blocking antibody, which was co-administered to overcome the suppressor function of FcγRIIB in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We performed Fc glycoengineering to remove the fucose subunit from the Fc-attached glycan of avelumab to enhance its binding to the activating FcγRIIIA. Treatment with the Fc-afucosylated version of avelumab also enhanced antitumor activity and induced stronger antitumor immune responses compared with the parental IgG. The enhanced effect by afucosylated PD-L1 antibody was dependent on neutrophils and associated with decreased frequencies of PD-L1+ myeloid cells and increased infiltration of T cells in the TME.

Positive selection of BGC cells is controlled by signals received through the B cell receptor (BCR) and follicular helper T (TFH) cell–derived signals, in particular costimulation through CD40. Here, we demonstrate that the TFH cell effector cytokine interleukin-21 (IL-21) joins BCR and CD40 in supporting BGC selection and reveal that strong IL-21 signaling prioritizes ASC differentiation in vivo. BGC cells, compared with non-BGC cells, show significantly reduced IL-21 binding and attenuated signaling, which is mediated by low cellular heparan sulfate (HS) sulfation. Mechanistically, N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase 1 (Ndst1)–mediated N-sulfation of HS in B cells promotes IL-21 binding and signal strength. Ndst1 is down-regulated in BGC cells and up-regulated in ASC precursors, suggesting selective desensitization to IL-21 in BGC cells.

However, it remains largely unknown whether their immunomodulatory functions are intrinsic or acquired within the pathological tissue environment. Here, using mouse models of metastatic breast cancer in the lungs, we show that, although neutrophils isolated from bone marrow (BM) or blood are minimally immunosuppressive, lung-infiltrating neutrophils are robustly suppressive of both T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. We found that this tissue-specific immunosuppressive capacity of neutrophils exists in the steady state and is reinforced by tumor-associated inflammation. Acquisition of potent immunosuppression activity by lung-infiltrating neutrophils was endowed by the lung-resident stroma, specifically CD140a+ mesenchymal cells (MCs) and largely via prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), the rate-limiting enzyme for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) biosynthesis. MC-specific deletion of Ptgs2 or pharmacological inhibition of PGE2 receptors reversed lung neutrophil–mediated immunosuppression and mitigated lung metastasis of breast cancer in vivo. These lung stroma–targeting strategies substantially improved the therapeutic efficacy of adoptive T cell–based immunotherapy in treating metastatic disease in mice. Collectively, our results reveal that the immunoregulatory effects of neutrophils are induced by tissue-resident stroma and that targeting tissue-specific stromal factors represents an effective approach to boost tissue-resident immunity against metastatic disease.","2023-02-17","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-28 02:32:07","eadd5204","","80","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/D5QSBCYP/Gong et al. - 2023 - Immunosuppressive reprogramming of neutrophils by .pdf","","Log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that CD4bs bNAbs resembling the antibody IOMA might be easier to elicit than other CD4bs antibodies that exhibit higher somatic mutation rates, a difficult-to-achieve mechanism to accommodate Env’s N276gp120 N-glycan, and rare five-residue light chain complementarity-determining region 3. As an initial test of this idea, we developed IOMA germline–targeting Env immunogens and evaluated a sequential immunization regimen in transgenic mice expressing germline-reverted IOMA. These mice developed CD4bs epitope–specific responses with heterologous neutralization, and cloned antibodies overcame neutralization roadblocks, including accommodating the N276gp120 glycan, with some neutralizing selected HIV-1 strains more potently than IOMA. The immunization regimen also elicited CD4bs-specific responses in mice containing polyclonal antibody repertoires as well as rabbits and rhesus macaques. Thus, germline targeting of IOMA-class antibody precursors represents a potential vaccine strategy to induce CD4bs bNAbs.","2023-02-10","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-28 02:32:08","eade6364","","80","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/DRRAGW8Z/Gristick et al. - 2023 - CD4 binding site immunogens elicit heterologous an.pdf","","No bar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Induction of antitumor T cells in immunogenic tumors depends on STING, the intracellular innate immune receptor for cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) and related cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs). However, the optimal way to leverage STING activation in nonimmunogenic tumors is still unclear. Here, we show that cGAMP delivery by intratumoral injection of virus-like particles (cGAMP-VLP) led to differentiation of circulating tumor-specific T cells, decreased tumor regulatory T cells (Tregs), and antitumoral responses that synergized with PD1 blockade. By contrast, intratumoral injection of the synthetic CDN ADU-S100 led to tumor necrosis and systemic T cell activation but simultaneously depleted immune cells from injected tumors and induced minimal priming of circulating tumor-specific T cells. The antitumor effects of cGAMP-VLP required type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1), whereas ADU-S100 eliminated cDC1 from injected tumors. cGAMP-VLP preferentially targeted STING in dendritic cells at a 1000-fold smaller dose than ADU-S100. Subcutaneous administration of cGAMP-VLP showed synergy when combined with PD1 blockade or a tumor Treg-depleting antibody to elicit systemic tumor-specific T cells and antitumor activity, leading to complete and durable tumor eradication in the case of tumor Treg depletion. These findings show that cell targeting of STING stimulation shapes the antitumor T cell response and identify a therapeutic strategy to enhance T cell–targeted immunotherapy.","2023-01-13","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-28 02:32:10","eabn6612","","79","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/ZYAR2YKM/Jneid et al. - 2023 - Selective STING stimulation in dendritic cells pri.pdf","","Log","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Human cGAS contained a catalytic domain that was intrinsically self-DNA reactive and stimulated interferon responses in diverse cell types. This reactivity was prevented by an upstream amino (N)-terminal domain. The cGAS proteins from several nonhuman primate species exhibited a similar pattern of self-DNA reactivity in cells, but chimpanzee cGAS was inactive even when its amino-terminal domain was deleted. In contrast, the N terminus of mouse cGAS promoted self-DNA reactivity. When expressed within tumors, only self-DNA–reactive cGAS proteins protected mice from tumor-induced lethality. In vitro studies of DNA- or chromatin-induced cGAS activation did not reveal species-specific activities that correlate with self-DNA reactivity observed in macrophages. Cell biological analysis revealed that self-DNA reactivity by human cGAS, but not mouse cGAS, correlated with localization to mitochondria. We found that epitope tag positions affected self-DNA reactivity in cells and that DNA present in cell lysates undermines the reliability of cGAS biochemical fractionations.

Transferrin receptor (CD71) was identified as differentially critical for TH1 and inhibitory for induced regulatory T cells (iTregs). Activated T cells induced CD71 and iron uptake, which was exaggerated in SLE-prone T cells. Cell surface CD71 was enhanced in SLE-prone T cells by increased endosomal recycling. Blocking CD71 reduced intracellular iron and mTORC1 signaling, which inhibited TH1 and TH17 cells yet enhanced iTregs. In vivo treatment reduced kidney pathology and increased CD4 T cell production of IL-10 in SLE-prone mice. Disease severity correlated with CD71 expression on TH17 cells from patients with SLE, and blocking CD71 in vitro enhanced IL-10 secretion. T cell iron uptake via CD71 thus contributes to T cell dysfunction and can be targeted to limit SLE-associated pathology.","2023-01-13","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-06-11 00:42:53","2024-05-28 02:32:12","eabq0178","","79","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","science.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Association for the Advancement of Science","","/Users/tlin/Zotero/storage/3YVILINC/Voss et al. - 2023 - Elevated transferrin receptor impairs T cell metab.pdf","","Zero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Shortly after the initial two mRNA vaccine doses, the immunoglobulin G (IgG) response mainly consists of the proinflammatory subclasses IgG1 and IgG3. Here, we report that several months after the second vaccination, SARS-CoV-2–specific antibodies were increasingly composed of noninflammatory IgG4, which were further boosted by a third mRNA vaccination and/or SARS-CoV-2 variant breakthrough infections. IgG4 antibodies among all spike-specific IgG antibodies rose, on average, from 0.04% shortly after the second vaccination to 19.27% late after the third vaccination. This induction of IgG4 antibodies was not observed after homologous or heterologous SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with adenoviral vectors. Single-cell sequencing and flow cytometry revealed substantial frequencies of IgG4-switched B cells within the spike-binding memory B cell population [median of 14.4%; interquartile range (IQR) of 6.7 to 18.1%] compared with the overall memory B cell repertoire (median of 1.3%; IQR of 0.9 to 2.2%) after three immunizations. This class switch was associated with a reduced capacity of the spike-specific antibodies to mediate antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and complement deposition.

We report a recurrent heterozygous mutation in IRF4, p.T95R, causing an autosomal dominant combined immunodeficiency (CID) in seven patients from six unrelated families. The patients exhibited profound susceptibility to opportunistic infections, notably Pneumocystis jirovecii, and presented with agammaglobulinemia. Patients’ B cells showed impaired maturation, decreased immunoglobulin isotype switching, and defective plasma cell differentiation, whereas their T cells contained reduced TH17 and TFH populations and exhibited decreased cytokine production. A knock-in mouse model of heterozygous T95R showed a severe defect in antibody production both at the steady state and after immunization with different types of antigens, consistent with the CID observed in these patients. The IRF4T95R variant maps to the TF’s DNA binding domain, alters its canonical DNA binding specificities, and results in a simultaneous multimorphic combination of loss, gain, and new functions for IRF4. IRF4T95R behaved as a gain-of-function hypermorph by binding to DNA with higher affinity than IRF4WT. Despite this increased affinity for DNA, the transcriptional activity on IRF4 canonical genes was reduced, showcasing a hypomorphic activity of IRF4T95R. Simultaneously, IRF4T95R functions as a neomorph by binding to noncanonical DNA sites to alter the gene expression profile, including the transcription of genes exclusively induced by IRF4T95R but not by IRF4WT.

Here, we describe an essential role for TGFβ in the control of tissue-specific immune homeostasis that provides mechanistic insight into these clinical associations. Mice expressing a TGFβR1 loss-of-function variant identified in atopic patients spontaneously develop disease that clinically, immunologically, histologically, and transcriptionally recapitulates eosinophilic esophagitis. In vivo and in vitro, TGFβR1 variant–expressing epithelial cells are hyperproliferative, fail to differentiate properly, and overexpress innate proinflammatory mediators, which persist in the absence of lymphocytes or external allergens.

Here, we screened abundant flagellins present in metagenomes from human gut for both TLR5 recognition and activation and uncovered a class of flagellin-TLR5 interaction termed silent recognition. Silent flagellins were weak TLR5 agonists despite pattern recognition. Receptor activity was tuned by a TLR5-flagellin interaction distal to the site of pattern recognition that was present in Salmonella flagellin but absent in silent flagellins. This interaction enabled flagellin binding to preformed TLR5 dimers and increased TLR5 signaling by several orders of magnitude. Silent recognition by TLR5 occurred in human organoids and mice, and silent flagellin proteins were present in human stool. These flagellins were produced primarily by the abundant gut bacteria Lachnospiraceae and were enriched in nonindustrialized populations.
